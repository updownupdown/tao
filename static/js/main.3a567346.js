Earth attaining the One Became stable. Spirits attaining the One Became sacred.\nValleys attaining the One Became bountiful. Myriad beings attaining the One Became fertile.

Death is only the thirteen body parts. Human life, moving towards death, Is the same thirteen. Why is this? Because life gives life to substance.\nYou have heard of people Good at holding on to life.

who considers himself right is not illustrious;\nHe who brags will have no merit;\nHe who boasts will not endure.\n\nFrom the point of view of the way these are 'excessive food and useless excresences'.\nAs there are Things that detest them, he who has the way does not abide in them."},{chapter:25,content:"There is a thing confusedly formed,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nGoes round and does not weary.\nIt is capable of being the mother of the world.\nI know not its name\nSo I style it 'the way'.\n\nI give it the makeshift name of 'the great'.\nBeing great, it is further described as receding,\nReceding, it is described as far away,\nBeing far away, it is described as turning back.\n\nHence the way is great;\nHeaven is great;\nEarth is great;\nThe king is also great.\nWithin the realm there are four things that are great,\nAnd the king counts as one.\n\nMan models himself on earth,\nEarth on heaven,\nHeaven on the way,\nAnd the way on that which is naturally so."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is the root of the light;\nThe still is the lord of the restless.\n\nTherefore the gentleman when travelling all day\nNever lets the heavily laden carts out of his sight.\nIt is only when he is safely behind walls and watch-towers\nThat he rests peacefully and is above worries.\nHow, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nMake light of his own person in the eyes of the empire?\n\nIf light, then the root is lost;\nIf restless, then the lord is lost."},{chapter:27,content:"One who excels in travelling leaves no wheel tracks;\nOne who excels in speech makes no slips;\nOne who excels in reckoning uses no counting rods;\nOne who excels in shutting uses no bolts yet what he has shut cannot be opened.\nOne who excels in tying uses no cords yet what he has tied cannot be undone.\n\nTherefore the sage always excels in saving people, and so abandons no one;\nAlways excels in saving things, and so abandons nothing.\n\nThis is called following one's discernment.\n\nHence the good man is the teacher the bad learns from;\nAnd the bad man is the material the good works on.\nNot to value the teacher\nNor to love the material\nThough it seems clever, betrays great bewilderment.\n\nThis is called the essential and the secret."},{chapter:28,content:"Know the male\nBut keep to the role of the female\nAnd be a ravine to the empire.\nIf you are a ravine to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not desert you\nAnd you will again return to being a babe.\n\nKnow the white\nBut keep to the role of the sullied\nAnd be a model to the empire.\nIf you are a model to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will not be wanting\nAnd you will return to the infinite,\n\nKnow honour\nBut keep to the role of the disgraced\nAnd be a valley to the empire.\nIf you are a valley to the empire,\nThen the constant virtue will be sufficient\nAnd you will return to being the uncarved block.\n\nWhen the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels.\nThe sage makes use of these and becomes the lord over the officials.\n\nHence the greatest cutting does not sever."},{chapter:29,content:"Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite.\nThe empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it.\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nwhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\n\nHence some things lead and some follow;\nSome breathe gently and some breathe hard;\nSome are strong and some are weak;\nSome destroy and some are destroyed.\n\nTherefore the sage avoids excess, extravagance, and arrogance."},{chapter:30,content:"One who assists the ruler of men by means of the way does not intimidate the empire by a show of arms.\n\nThis is something which is liable to rebound.\nWhere troops have encamped\nThere will brambles grow;\nIn the wake of a mighty army\nBad harvests follow without fail.\n\nOne who is good aims only at bringing his campaign to a conclusion and dare not thereby intimidate.\nBring it to a conclusion but do not brag;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant;\nBring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice;\nBring it to a conclusion but do not intimidate.\n\nA creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.\nThat which goes against the way will come to an early end."},{chapter:31,content:"It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use.\nThe gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war.\nArms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman.\nWhen one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish.\nThere is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men.\nOne who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire.\nOn occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left;\nOn occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right.\nA lieutenants place is on the left;\nThe general's place is on the right.\nThis means that it is mourning rites that are observed.\nWhen great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow.\nWhen victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning."},{chapter:32,content:"The way is for ever nameless.\nThough the uncarved block is small\nNo one in the world dare claim its allegiance.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it\nThe myriad creatures will submit of their own accord,\nHeaven and earth will unite and sweet dew will fall,\nAnd the people will be equitable, though no one so decrees.\nOnly when it is cut are there names.\nAs soon as there are names\nOne ought to know that it is time to stop.\nKnowing when to stop one can be free from danger.\n\nThe way is to the world as the River and the Sea are to

knows contentment is rich;\nHe who perseveres is a man of purpose;\nHe who does not lose his station will endure;\nHe who lives out his days has had a long life."},{chapter:34,content:"The way is broad, reaching left as well as right.\nThe myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master.\n\nFor ever free of desire, it can be called small;\nYet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called great.\n\nIt is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeeds in becoming great."},{chapter:35,content:"Have in your hold the great image\nAnd the empire will come to you.\nComing to you and meeting with no harm\nIt will be safe and sound.\nMusic and food\nWill induce the wayfarer to stop.\n\nThe way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt cannot be heard,\nYet it cannot be exhausted by use."},{chapter:36,content:"If you would have a thing shrink,\nYou must first stretch it;\nIf you would have a thing weakened,\nYou must first strengthen it;\nIf you would have a thing laid aside,\nYou must first set it up;\nIf you would take from a thing,\nYou must first give to it.\n\nThis is called subtle discernment:\nThe submissive and weak will overcome the hard and strong.\n\nThe fish must not be allowed to leave the deep;\nThe instruments of power in a state must not be revealed to anyone."},{chapter:37,content:"The way never acts, yet nothing is left undone.\nShould lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,\nThe myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord.\nAfter they are transformed, should desire raise its head,\nI shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block.\nThe nameless uncarved block\nIs but freedom from desire,\nAnd if I cease to desire and remain still,\nThe empire will be at peace of its own accord."},{chapter:38,content:"A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue.\nA man of the lowest virtue never strays from virtue and that is why he is without virtue.\nThe former never acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe latter acts but there are things left undone.\nA man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive.\nA man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive.\nA man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force.\n\nHence when the way was lost there was virtue;\nWhen virtue was lost there was benevolence;\nWhen benevolence was lost there was rectitude;\nWhen rectitude was lost there were the rites.\n\nThe rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith\nAnd the beginning of disorder;\nForeknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way\nAnd the beginning of folly.\n\nHence the man of large mind abides in the thick not in the thin, in the fruit not in the flower.\n\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other."},{chapter:39,content:"Of old, these came to be in possession of the One:\nHeaven in virtue of the One is limpid;\nEarth in virtue of the One is settled;\nGods in virtue of the One have their potencies;\nThe valley in virtue of the One is full;\nThe myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive;\nLords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire.\nIt is the One that makes these what they are.\n\nWithout what makes it limpid heaven

keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish;\nWithout what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall.\n\nHence the superior must have the inferior as root;\nThe high must have the low as base.\n\nThus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'.\nThis is taking the inferior as root, is it not?\n\nHence the highest renown is without renown,\nNot wishing to be one among many like jade\nNor to be aloof like stone."},{chapter:40,content:"Turning back is how the way moves;\nWeakness is the means the way employs.\n\nThe myriad creatures in the world are born from\nSomething, and Something from Nothing."},{chapter:41,content:"When the best student hears about the way\nHe practises it assiduously;\nWhen the average student hears about the way\nIt seems to him there one moment and gone the next;\nWhen the worst student hears about the way\nHe laughs out loud.\nIf he did not laugh\nIt would be unworthy of being the way.\n\nHence the Chien yen has it:\nThe way that is bright seems dull;\nThe way that is forward seems to lead backward;\nThe way that is even seems rough.\nThe highest virtue is like the valley;\nThe sheerest whiteness seems sullied;\nAmple virtue seems defective;\nVigorous virtue seems indolent;\nPlain virtue seems soiled;\nThe great square has no corners.\nThe great vessel takes long to complete;\nThe great note is rarefied in sound;\nThe great image has no shape.\n\nThe way conceals itself in being nameless.\nIt is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing."},{chapter:42,content:"The way begets one;\nOne begets two;\nTwo begets three;\nThree begets the myriad creatures.\n\nThe myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two.\n\nThere are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves.\n\nThus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to.\n\nWhat others teach I also teach.\n'The violent shall not come to a natural end.'\nI shall take this as my precept."},{chapter:43,content:"Exterminate learning, and there will no longer be worries.\n\nThe most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the hardest in the world;\nThat which is without substance entering that which has no crevices.\n\nThat is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action.\nThe teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action, these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world."},{chapter:44,content:"Your name or your person,\nWhich is dearer?\nYour person or your goods,\nWhich is worth

greater than being covetous.\n\nHence in being content, one will always have enough."},{chapter:47,content:"Without stirring abroad\nOne can know the whole world;\nWithout looking out the window\nOne can see the way of heaven.\nThe further one goes\nThe less one knows.\nTherefore the sage knows without having to stir,\nIdentifies without having to see,\nAccomplishes without having to act."},{chapter:48,content:"In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day;\nIn the pursuit of the way one does less every day.\nOne does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one

doing I gain in goodness.\nThose who are of good faith I have faith in.\nThose who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in.\nIn so doing I gain in good faith.\n\nThe sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it.\nThe people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children."},{chapter:50,content:"When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so? Because they set too much store by life.\nI have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.\nThere is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;\nThere is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;\nThere is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.\nWhy is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death."},{chapter:51,content:"The way gives them life;\nVirtue rears them;\nThings give them shape;\nCircumstances bring them to maturity.\n\nTherefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.\nYet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\n\nThus the

the constant."},{chapter:53,content:"Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.\nThe great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.\n\nThe court is corrupt,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty;\nYet there are those dressed in fineries,\nWith swords at their sides,\nFilled with food and

genuine;\nCultivate it in the family\nAnd its virtue will be more than sufficient;\nCultivate it in the hamlet\nAnd its virtue will endure;\nCultivate it in the state\nAnd its virtue will abound;\nCultivate it in the empire\nAnd its virtue will be pervasive.\n\nHence look at the person through the person;\nLook at the family through the family;\nLook at the hamlet through the

hoarse:\nThis is because its harmony is at its height.\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called discernment.\nTo try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened;\nFor

wheels move only along old ruts.\n\nThis is known as mysterious sameness.\n\nHence you cannot get close to it, nor can you keep it at arm's length;\nYou cannot bestow benefit on it, nor can you do it harm;\nYou cannot ennoble it, nor can you debase it.\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire."},{chapter:57,content:"Govern the state by being straightforward;\nWage war by being crafty;\nBut win the empire by not being meddlesome.\n\nHow do I know that it is like that?\nBy means of this.\n\nThe more taboos there are in the empire\nThe poorer the people;\nThe more sharpened tools the people have\nThe more benighted the state;\nThe more skills the people have\nThe further novelties multiply;\nThe better known the laws and edicts\nThe more thieves and robbers there are.\n\nHence the sage says,\nI take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;\nI prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;\nI am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;\nI am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block."},{chapter:58,content:"When the government is muddled\nThe people are simple;\nWhen the government is alert\nThe

Does not the straightforward exist?\nThe straighforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changes again into the monstrous.\nIndeed, it is long since the people were perplexed.\n\nTherefore

and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler to be sparing.\nIt is because he is sparing\nThat he may be said to follow the way from the start;\nFollowing the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue;\nAccumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;\nWhen there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit;\nWhen no one knows his limit\nHe can possess a state;\nWhen he possesses the mother of a state\nHe can then endure.\nThis is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one lives to see many days."},{chapter:60,content:"Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.\n\nWhen the empire is ruled in accordance with the way,\nThe spirits lose their potencies.\nOr rather, it is not that they lose their potencies,\nBut that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people.\nIt is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people,\nThe sage, also, does not harm the people.\nAs neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other."},{chapter:61,content:"A large state is the lower reaches of a river:\nThe place where all the streams of the world unite.\n\nIn the union of the world,\nThe female always gets the better of the male by stillness.\n\nBeing still, she takes the lower position.\n\nHence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state;\nThe small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state.\n\nThus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;\nThe other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.\nAll that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;\nAll that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other.\nIf each of the two wants to find its proper place,\nIt is meet that the large should take the lower position."},{chapter:62,content:"The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.\nIt is that by which the good man protects,\nAnd that by which the bad is protected.\n\nBeautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;\nBeautiful deeds can raise a man above others.\n\nEven if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?\n\nHence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.\nWhy was this way valued of old?\nWas it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed?\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire."},{chapter:63,content:"Do that which consists in taking no action;\nPursue that which is not meddlesome;\nSavor that which has no flavor.\n\nMake the small big and the few many;\nDo good to him who has done you an injury.\n\nLay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult;\nMake something big by starting with it when small.\n\nDifficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in the easy;\nBig things must needs have their beginnings in the small.\n\nTherefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great.\n\nOne who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;\nOne who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\nThat is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him."},{chapter:64,content:"It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;\nIt is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop;\nIt is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle;\nIt is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.\n\nDeal with a thing while it is still nothing;\nKeep a thing in order before disorder sets in.\n\nA tree that can fill the span of a man's arms\nGrows from a downy tip;\nA terrace nine storeys high\nRises from hodfuls of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles\nStarts from beneath one's feet.\n\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nWhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\n\nTherefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything;\nAnd, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing.\n\nIn their enterprises the people\nAlways ruin them when on the verge of success.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning\nAnd there will be no ruined enterprises.\n\nTherefore the sage desires not to desire\nAnd does not value goods which are hard to come by;\nLearns to be without learning\nAnd makes good the mistakes of the multitude\nIn order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act."},{chapter:65,content:"Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.\nThe reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.\n\nHence to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be to the detriment of the state;\nNot to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be a boon to the state.\nThese two are models.\nAlways to know the models\nIs known as mysterious virtue.\nMysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,\nBut when things turn back it turns back with them.\n\nOnly then is complete conformity realized."},{chapter:66,content:"The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundred valleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.\nHence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.\n\nTherefore, desiring to rule over the people,\nOne must in one's words humble oneself before them;\nAnd, desiring to lead the people,\nOne must, in one's person, follow behind them.\n\nTherefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden;\ntakes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.\nThat is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doing so.\n\nIt is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.\nIt is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.\nIf it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.\n\nI have three treasures\nWhich I hold and cherish.\nThe first is known as compassion,\nThe second is known as frugality,\nThe third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;\nBeing compassionate one could afford to be courageous,\nBeing frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,\nNot daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lord over the vessels.\n\nNow, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion, to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.\n\nThrough compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable in defence.\nWhat heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion."},{chapter:68,content:"One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;\nOne who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;\nOne who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;\nOne who excels in employing others

heaven."},{chapter:69,content:"The strategists have a saying,\nI dare not play the host but play the guest,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.\n\nThis is known as marching forward when there is no road,\nRolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm,\nDragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary,\nAnd taking up arms when there are no arms.\n\nThere is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily.\nSo doing nearly cost me my treasure.\nThus of two sides raising arms against each other,\nIt is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,\nYet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.\n\nWords have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.\n\nIt is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me.\nThose who understand me are few;\nThose who harm me are honoured.\n\nTherefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person a priceless piece of jade."},{chapter:71,content:"To know yet to think that one does not know is best;\nNot to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.\n\nIt is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it.\nThe sage meets with no difficulty.\nIt is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitation will descend upon them.\n\nDo not constrict their living space;\nDo not press down on their means of livelihood.\nIt is because you do not press down on them that they will not weary of the burden.\n\nHence the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other."},{chapter:73,content:"He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death;\nHe who is fearless in being timid will stay alive.\nOf the two, one leads to good, the other to harm.\n\nHeaven hates what it hates,\nWho knows the reason why?\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\n\nThe way of heaven\nExcels in overcoming though it does not contend,\nIn responding though it does not speak,\nIn attracting though it does not summon,\nIn laying plans though it appears slack.\n\nThe net of heaven is cast wide.\nThough the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through."},{chapter:74,content:"When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with death?\nWere the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put to death those who innovate, then who would dare?\nThere is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.\nTo kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter.\nIn chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who escape hurting their own hands instead."},{chapter:75,content:"The people are hungry:\nIt is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes\nThat the people are hungry.\nThe people are difficult to govern.\nIt is because those in authority are too fond of action\nThat the people are difficult to govern.\nThe people treat death lightly:\nIt is because the people set too much store by life\nThat they treat death

more submissive and weak than water.\nYet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.\nThis is because there is nothing that can take its place.\n\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nAnd the submissive overcomes the hard,\nEveryone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge into practice.\n\nTherefore the sage says,\nOne who takes on himself the humiliation of the state\nIs called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet.\nOne who takes on himself the calamity of the state\nIs called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire.\n\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When peace is made between great enemies,\nSome enmity is bound to remain undispelled.\nHow can this be considered

the way of heaven to show no favoritism.\nIt is for ever on the side of the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"Reduce the size of the population and the state.\nEnsure that even though the people have

ships and carts, they will have no use for them;\nAnd even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to make a show of them.\n\nBring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope,\nWill find relish in their food\nAnd beauty in their clothes,\nWill be content in their abode\nAnd happy in the way they live.\n\nThough adjoining states are within sight of one another,\nAnd the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another,\nyet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another."},{chapter:81,content:"Truthful words are not beautiful;\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nGood words are not persuasive;\nPersuasive words are not good.\nHe who knows has no wide learning;\nHe who has wide learning does not know.\n\nThe sage does not hoard.\nHaving bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more;\nHaving given all he has to others, he is richer still.\n\nThe

done;\nThe world is won by those who let it go!\nBut when you try and try,\nThe world is then beyond the winning."},{chapter:49,content:"The Wise Man's mind is free\nBut tuned to people's need:\n\n\"Alike to be good and bad\nI must be good,\nFor Virtue is goodness.\nTo honest folk\nAnd those dishonest ones\nAlike, I proffer faith,\nFor Virtue is faithful.\"\n\nThe Wise Man, when abroad,\nImpartial to the world,\nDoes not divide or judge.\nBut people everywhere\nMark well his ears and eyes;\nFor wise men hear and see\nAs little children do."},{chapter:50,content:"On leaving life, to enter death:\nThirteen members form a living body;\nA corpse has thirteen, too:\nThirteen spots by which a man may pass\nFrom life to death. Why so?\nBecause his way of life\nIs much too gross.\n\nAs I have heard, the man who knows\nOn land how best to be at peace\nWill never meet a tiger or a buffalo;\nIn battle, weapons do not touch his skin.\nThere is no place the tiger's claws can grip;\nOr with his horn, the buffalo can jab;\nOr where the soldier can insert his sword.\nWhy so? In him there is no place of death."},{chapter:51,content:"The Way brings forth,\nIts virtue fosters them,\nWith matter they take shape,\nAnd circumstance perfects them all:\n\nThat is why all things\nDo honor the Way\nAnd venerate its power.\n\nThe exaltation of the Way,\nThe veneration of its power,\nCome not by fate or decree;\nBut always just because\nBy nature it is so.\n\nSo when the Way brings forth,\nIts power fosters all:\nThey grow, are reared,\nAnd fed and housed until\nThey come to ripe maturity.\n\nYou shall give life to things\nBut never possess them;\nYour work shall depend on none;\nYou shall be chief but never lord.\nThis describes the mystic power."},{chapter:52,content:"It began with a matrix:\nThe world had a mother\nWhose sons can be known\nAs ever, by her.\nBut if you know them,\nYou'll keep close to her\nAs long as you live\nAnd suffer no harm.\n\nStop up your senses;\nClose up your doors;\nBe not exhausted\nAs long as you live.\nOpen your senses;\nBe busier still:\nTo the end of your days\nThere's no help for you.\n\nYou are bright, it is said,\nIf you see what is small;\nA store of small strengths\nMakes you strong.\nBy the use of its light,\nMake your eyes again bright\nFrom evil to lead you away.\n\nThis is called \"practicing constancy.\""},{chapter:53,content:"When I am walking on the mighty Way,\nLet me but know the very least I may,\nAnd I shall only fear to leave the road.\nThe mighty Way is easy underfoot,\nBut people still prefer the little paths.\n\nThe royal court is dignified, sedate,\nWhile farmers' fields are overgrown with weeds;\nThe granaries are empty and yet they\nAre clad in rich-embroidered silken gowns.\nThey have sharp swords suspended at their sides;\nWith glutted wealth, they gorge with food and drink.\n\nIt is, the people say,\nThe boastfulness of brigandage,\nBut surely not the Way!"},{chapter:54,content:"Set firm in the Way: none shall uproot you;\nCherish it well and none shall estrange you;\nYour children's children faithful shall serve\nYour forebears at the altar of your house.\n\nCultivate the Way yourself,\n\nand your Virtue will be genuine.\nCultivate it in the home,\n\nand its Virtue will overflow.\nCultivate it in the village,\n\nand the village will endure.\nCultivate it in the realm,\nand the realm will flourish.\nCultivate it in the world,\nand Virtue will be universal.\n\nAccordingly,\nOne will be judged by the Man of the Way;\nHomes will be viewed through the Home of the Way;\nAnd the Village shall measure the village;\nAnd the Realm, for all realms,

all completely formed,\nHis vital force is at its height.\nHe shouts all day, does not get hoarse:\nHis person is a harmony.\n\nHarmony experienced is known as constancy;\nConstancy experienced is

not to suit the Way is early death."},{chapter:56,content:"Those who know do not talk\nAnd talkers do not know.\n\nStop your senses,\nClose the doors;\nLet sharp things be blunted,\nTangles resolved,\nThe light tempered\nAnd turmoil subdued;\nFor this is mystic unity\nIn which the Wise Man is moved\nNeither by affection\nNor yet by estrangement\nOr profit or loss\nOr honor or shame.\nAccordingly, by all the world,\nHe is held highest."},{chapter:57,content:'"Govern the realm by the right,\nAnd battles by stratagem."\n\nThe world is won by refraining.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\n\nAs taboos increase, people grow poorer;\nWhen weapons abound, the state grows chaotic;\nWhere skills multiply, novelties flourish;\nAs statutes increase, more criminals start.\n\nSo the Wise Man will say:\n\nAs I refrain, the people will reform:\nSince I like quiet, they will keep order;\nWhen I forebear, the people will prosper;\nWhen I want nothing, they will be honest.'},{chapter:58,content:'Listlessly govern:\nHappy your people;\nGovern exactingly:\nRestless your people.\n\n"Bad fortune will\nPromote the good;\nGood fortune, too,\nGives rise to the bad."\n\nBut who can know to what that leads?\nFor it is wrong and would assign\nTo right the strangest derivations\nAnd would mean that goodness\nIs produced by magic means!\nHas man thus been so long astray?\n\nAccordingly, the Wise Man\nIs square but not sharp,\nHonest but not malign,\nStraight but not severe,\nBright but not dazzling.'},{chapter:59,content:'"For ruling men or serving God,\nThere\'s nothing else like stores saved up."\n\nBy "stores saved up" is meant forehandedness,\nAccumulate Virtue, such that nothing\nCan resist it and its limit\nNone can guess: such infinite resource\nAllows the jurisdiction of the king;\nWhose kingdom then will long endure\nIf it provides the Mother an abode.\nIndeed it is the deeply rooted base,\nThe firm foundation of the Way\nTo immortality of self and name.'},{chapter:60,content:"Rule a large country\nAs small fish are cooked.\n\nThe evil spirits of the world\nLose sanction as divinities\nWhen government proceeds\nAccording to the Way;\nBut even if they do not lose\nTheir ghostly countenance and right,\nThe people take no harm from them;\nAnd if the spirits cannot hurt the folk,\nThe Wise Man surely does no hurt to them.\n\nSince then the Wise Man and the people\nHarm each other not at all,\nTheir several virtues should converge."},{chapter:61,content:"The great land is a place\nTo which the streams descend;\nIt is the concourse and\nThe female of the world:\nQuiescent, underneath,\nIt overcomes the male.\n\nBy quietness and by humility\nThe great land then puts down the small\nAnd gets it for its own;\nBut small lands too absorb the great\nBy their subservience.\nThus some lie low, designing conquest's ends;\nWhile others lowly are, by nature bent\nTo conquer all the rest.\n\nThe great land's foremost need is to increase\nThe number of its folk;\nThe small land needs above all else to find\nIts folk more room to work.\nThat both be served and each attain its goal\nThe great land should attempt humility."},{chapter:62,content:"Like the gods of the shrine in the home,\nSo the Way and its mystery waits\nIn the world of material things:\nThe good man's treasure,\nThe bad man's refuge.\n\nFair wordage is ever for sale;\nFair manners are worn like a cloak;\nBut why should there be such waste\nOf the badness in men?\n\nOn the day of the emperor's crowning,\nWhen the three noble dukes are appointed,\nBetter than chaplets of jade\nDrawn by a team of four horses,\nBring the Way as your tribute.\n\nHow used the ancients to honor the Way?\nDidn't they say that the seeker may find it,\nAnd that sinners who find are forgiven?\nSo did they lift up the Way and its Virtue\nAbove everything else in the world."},{chapter:63,content:"Act in repose;\nBe at rest when you work;\nRelish unflavored things.\nGreat or small,\nFrequent or rare,\nRequite anger with virtue.\n\nTake hard jobs in hand\nWhile they are easy;\nAnd great affairs too\nWhile they are small.\nThe troubles of the world\nCannot be solved except\nBefore they grow too hard.\nThe business of the world\nCannot be done except\nWhile relatively small.\nThe Wise Man, then, throughout his life\nDoes nothing great and yet achieves\nA greatness of his own.\n\nAgain, a promise lightly made\nInspires little confidence;\nOr often trivial, sure that man\nWill often come to grief.\nChoosing hardship, then, the Wise Man\nNever meets with hardship all his life."},{chapter:64,content:"A thing that is still is easy to hold.\nGiven no omen, it is easy to plan.\nSoft things are easy to melt.\nSmall particles scatter easily.\nThe time to take care is before it is done.\nEstablish order before confusion sets in.\nTree trunks around which you can reach with\n\nyour arms were at first only minuscule sprouts.\nA nine-storied terrace began with a clod.\nA thousand-mile journey began with a foot put down.\n\nDoing spoils it, grabbing misses it;\nSo the Wise Man refrains from doing\n\nand doesn't spoil anything;\nHe grabs at nothing so never misses.\n\nPeople are constantly spoiling a project\nwhen it lacks only a step to completion.\nTo avoid making a mess of it,\nbe as careful of the end as you were of the beginning.\nSo the Wise Man wants the unwanted;\nhe sets no high value on anything\nbecause it is hard to get.\nHe studies what others neglect\nand restores to the world what multitudes have passed by.\nHis object is to restore everything to its natural course,\nbut he dares take no steps to that end."},{chapter:65,content:"Those ancients who were skilled in the Way\nDid not enlighten people by their rule\nBut had them ever held in ignorance:\nThe more the folk know what is going on\nThe harder it becomes to govern them.\n\nFor public knowledge of the government\nIs such a thief that it will spoil the realm;\nBut when good fortune brings good times to all\nThe land is ruled without publicity.\nTo know the difference between these two\nInvolves a standard to be sought and found.\n\nTo know that standard always, everywhere,\nIs mystic Virtue, justly known as such;\nWhich Virtue is so deep and reaching far,\nIt causes a return, things go back\nTo that prime concord which at first all shared."},{chapter:66,content:"How could the rivers and the seas\nBecome like kings to valleys?\nBecause of skill in lowliness\nThey have become the valley's lords.\n\nSo then to be above the folk,\nYou speak as if you were beneath;\nAnd if you wish to be out front,\nThen act as if you were behind.\n\nThe Wise Man so is up above\nBut is no burden to the folk;\nHis station is ahead of them\nTo see they do not come to harm.\n\nThe world will gladly help along\nThe Wise Man and will bear no grudge.\nSince he contends not for his own\nThe world will not contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"Everywhere, they say the Way, our doctrine,\nIs so very like detested folly;\nBut greatness of its own alone explains\nWhy it should be thus held beyond the pale.\nIf it were only orthodox, long since\nIt would have seemed a small and petty thing!\n\nI have to keep three treasures well secured:\nThe first, compassion; next, frugality;\nAnd third, I say that never would I once\nPresume that I should be the whole world's chief.\n\nGiven compassion, I can take courage;\nGiven frugality, I can abound;\nIf I can be the world's most humble man,\nThen I can be its highest instrument.\n\nBravery today knows no compassion;\nAbundance is, without frugality,\nAnd eminence without humility:\nThis is the death indeed of all our hope.\n\nIn battle, 'tis compassion

conqueror does not give battle;\nA great commander is a humble man.\n\nYou may call this pacific virtue;\nOr say that it is mastery of men;\nOr that it is rising to the measure of God,\nOr to the stature of the ancients."},{chapter:69,content:'The strategists have a saying:\n\n"If I cannot be host,\nThen let me be guest.\nBut if I dare not advance\nEven an inch,\nThen let me retire a foot."\nThis is what they call\nA campaign without a march,\nSleeves up but no bare arms,\nShooting but no enemies,\nOr arming without weapons.\nThan helpless enemies, nothing is worse:\nTo them I lose my treasures.\nWhen opposing enemies meet,\nThe compassionate man is the winner!'},{chapter:70,content:"My words are easy just to understand:\nTo live by them is very easy too;\nYet it appears that none in all the world\nCan understand or make them come to life.\n\nMy words have ancestors, my works a prince;\nSince none know this, unknown I too remain.\nBut honor comes to me when least I'm

disease;\nBut if you recognize the malady\nOf mind for what it is, then that is health.\n\nThe Wise Man has indeed a healthy mind;\nHe sees an aberration as it is\nAnd for that reason never will be ill."},{chapter:72,content:"If people do not dread your majesty,\nA greater dread will yet descend on them.\nSee then you do not cramp their dwelling place,\nOr immolate their children or their stock,\nNor anger them by your own angry ways.\n\nIt is the Wise Man's way to know himself,\nAnd never to reveal his inward thoughts;\nHe loves himself but so, is not set up;\nHe chooses this in preference to that."},{chapter:73,content:"A brave man who dares to, will kill;\nA brave man who dares not, spares life;\nAnd from them both come good and ill;\n\"God hates some folks, but who knows why?\"\nThe Wise Man hesitates there too:\nGod's Way is bound to conquer all\nBut not by strife does it proceed.\n\nNot by words does God get answers:\nHe calls them not and all things come.\nMaster plans unfold but slowly,\nLike God's wide net enclosing all:\nIts mesh is coarse but none are lost."},{chapter:74,content:"The people do not fear at all to die;\nWhat's gained therefore by threatening them with death?\nIf you could always make them fear decease,\nAs if it were a strange event and rare,\nWho then would dare to take and slaughter them?\nThe executioner is always set\nTo slay, but those who substitute for him\nAre like would-be master carpenters\nWho try to chop as that skilled craftsman does\nAnd nearly always mangle their own hands!"},{chapter:75,content:"The people starve because of those\nAbove them, who consume by tax\nIn grain and kind more than their right.\nFor this, the people are in want.\n\nThe people are so hard to rule\nBecause of those who are above them,\nWhose interference makes distress.\nFor this, they are so hard to rule.\n\nThe people do not fear to die;\nThey too demand to live secure:\nFor this, they do not fear to die.\nSo they, without the means to live,\nIn virtue rise above those men\nWho value life above its worth."},{chapter:76,content:"Alive, a man is supple, soft;\nIn death, unbending, rigorous.\nAll creatures, grass and trees, alive\nAre plastic but are pliat too,\nAnd dead, are friable and dry.\n\nUnbending rigor is the mate of death,\nAnd wielding softness, company of life:\nUnbending soldiers get no victories;\nThe stiffest tree is readiest for the ax.\nThe strong and mighty topple from their place;\nThe soft and yielding rise above them all."},{chapter:77,content:"Is not God's Way much like a bow well bent?\nThe upper part has been disturbed, pressed down;\nThe lower part is raised up from its place;\nThe slack is taken up; the slender width\nIs broader drawn; for thus the Way of God\nCuts people down when they have had too much,\nAnd fills the bowls of those who are in want.\nBut not the way of man will work like this:\nThe people who have not enough are spoiled\nFor tribute to the rich and surfeited.\n\nWho can benefit the world\nFrom stored abundance of his own?\nHe alone who has the Way,\nThe Wise Man who can act apart\nAnd not depend on others' whims;\nBut not because of his high rank\nWill he succeed; he does not wish\nTo flaunt superiority."},{chapter:78,content:"Nothing is weaker than water,\nBut when it attacks something hard\nOr resistant, then nothing withstands it,\nAnd nothing will alter its way.\n\nEveryone knows this, that weakness prevails\nOver strength and that gentleness conquers\nThe adamant hindrance of men, but that\nNobody demonstrates how it is so.\n\nBecause of this the Wise Man says\nThat only one who bears the nations shame\nIs fit to be its hallowed lord;\nThat only one who takes upon himself\nThe evils of the world may be its king.\n\nThis is paradox."},{chapter:79,content:'How can you think it is good\nTo settle a grievance too great\nTo ignore, when the settlement\nSurely evokes other piques?\n\nThe Wise Man therefore will select\nThe left-hand part of contract tallies:\nHe will not put the debt on other men.\nThis virtuous man promotes agreement;\nThe vicious man allots the blame.\n\n"Impartial though the Way of God may be,\nIt always favors good men."'},{chapter:80,content:"The ideal land is small\nIts people very few,\nWhere tools abound\nTen times or yet\nA hundred-fold\nBeyond their use;\nWhere people

meat is sweet;\nTheir clothes adorned,\nTheir homes at peace,\nTheir customs charm.\n\nAnd neighbor lands\nAre juxtaposed\nSo each may hear\nThe barking dogs,\nThe crowing cocks\nAcross the way;\nWhere folks grow old\nAnd folks will die\nAnd never once\nExchange a call."},{chapter:81,content:"As honest words may not sound fine,\nFine words may not be honest ones;\nA good man does not argue, and\nAn arguer may not be good!\nThe knowers are not learned men\nAnd learned men may never know.\n\nThe Wise Man does not hoard his things;\nHard-pressed, from serving other men,\nHe has enough and some to spare;\nBut having given all he had,\nHe then is very rich indeed.\n\nGod's Way is gain that works no harm;\nThe Wise Man's way, to do his work\nWithout contending for a

itself\nWith unending motherhood.\nThough there can be no name for it,\nI have called it 'the way of life.'\nPerhaps I should have called it 'the fullness of life,'\nSince fullness implies widening

The Namable becomes of the ten thousand things the mother.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n\n"He who desireless is found\nThe spiritual of the world will sound.\nBut he who by desire is bound\nSees the mere shell of things around."\n\nThese two things are the same in source but different in name. Their sameness is called a mystery. Indeed, it is the mystery of mysteries. Of all spirituality it is the door.'},{chapter:2,content:'Everywhere it is obvious that if beauty makes a display of beauty, it is sheer ugliness. It is obvious that if goodness makes a display of goodness, it is sheer badness. For\n\n"To be and not to be are mutually conditioned.\nThe difficult, the easy, are mutually definitioned.\nThe long, the short, are mutually exhibitioned.\nAbove, below, are mutually cognitioned.\nThe sound, the voice, are mutually coalitioned.\nBefore and after are mutually positioned."\n\nTherefore\n\nThe holy man abides by non-assertion in his affairs and conveys by silence his instruction.

He weakens their ambition but strengthens their bones. Always he keeps the people unsophisticated and without desire. He causes that the crafty do not dare to act. When he acts with non-assertion there is nothing ungoverned."},{chapter:4,content:'Reason is empty, but its use is inexhaustible. In its profundity, verily, it resembleth the arch-father of the ten thousand things.\n\n"It will blunt its own sharpness,\nWill its tangles adjust;\nIt will dim its own radiance\nAnd be one with its dust."\n\nOh, how calm it seems to remain! I know not whose son it is. Apparently even the Lord it precedes.'},{chapter:5,content:"But for heaven and earth's humaneness, the ten thousand things are straw dogs. But for the holy man's humaneness, the hundred families are straw dogs.\n\nIs not the space between heaven and earth like unto a bellows? It is empty; yet it collapses not.

And why can heaven and earth endure and be lasting? Because they do not live for themselves. On that account can they endure.\n\nTherefore\n\nThe holy man puts his person behind and his person comes to the front. He surrenders his person and his person is preserved.

The water's goodness benefiteth the ten thousand things, yet it quarreleth not.\n\nWater dwelleth in the places which the multitudes of men shun; therefore it is near unto the eternal Reason\n\nThe dwelling of goodness is in lowliness. The heart of goodness is in commotion. When giving, goodness showeth benevolence. In words, goodness keepeth faith. In government goodness standeth for order. In business goodness exhibiteth ability. The movements of goodness keep time.\n\nIt quarreleth not. Therefore it is not rebuked."},{chapter:9,content:"Grasp to the full, are you not likely foiled? Scheme too sharply, can you wear long?

By concentrating his vitality and inducing tenderness he can become like a little child. By purifying, by cleansing and profound intuition he can be free from faults.\n\nWho loves the people when administering the country will practise nonassertion.\n\nOpening and closing the gates of heaven, he will be like a mother-bird; bright, and white, and penetrating the four quarters, he will be unsophisticated.

When I have no body, what heartache remains?\n\nTherefore who administers the empire as he takes care of his body can be entrusted with the empire.'},{chapter:14,content:"We look at Reason and do not see it; its name is Colorless. We listen to Reason and do not hear it; its name is Soundless. We grope for Reason and do not grasp it; its name is Bodiless.\n\nThese three things cannot further be analyzed. Thus they are combined and conceived as a unity which on its surface is not clear and in its depth not obscure.\n\nForever and aye Reason remains unnamable, and again and again it returns home to non-existence.\n\nThis is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. This is called the transcendentally abstruse.\n\nIn front its beginning is not seen.

Now they bloom in bloom but each one homeward returneth to its root.\n\nReturning to the root means rest. It signifies the return according to destiny. Return according to destiny means the eternal. Knowing the eternal means enlightenment. Not knowing the eternal causes passions to rise; and that is evil.\n\nKnowing the eternal renders comprehensive. Comprehensiveness renders broad. Breadth renders royal. Royalty renders heavenly. Heaven renders Reason-like. Reason renders lasting.

Merit they accomplished; deeds they performed; and the hundred families thought: "We are independent."'},{chapter:18,content:"When the great Reason is obliterated, we have benevolence and justice. Prudence and circumspection appear, and we have much hypocrisy.\n\nWhen family relations no longer harmonize, we have filial piety and paternal devotion.

Therefore it is said:\n\n"Hold fast to that which will endure,\nShow thyself simple, preserve thee pure,\nAnd lessen self with desires fewer."'},{chapter:20,content:'Abandon learnedness, and you have no vexation. The "yes" compared with the "yea," how little do they differ! But the good compared with the bad, how much do they differ!\n\nIf what the people dread cannot be made dreadless, there will be desolation, alas! and verily, there will be no end of it.\n\nThe multitudes of men are happy, so happy, as though celebrating a great feast.

I alone differ from others, but I prize seeking sustenance from our mother.'},{chapter:21,content:'"Vast virtue\'s form\nFollows Reason\'s norm.\n\n"And Reason\'s nature\nIs vague and eluding.\n\n"How eluding and vague\nAll types including!\nHow vague and eluding,\nAll beings including!\nHow deep and how obscure.\nIt harbors the spirit pure,\nWhose truth is ever sure,\nWhose faith abides for aye\nFrom of yore until to-day.\n\n"Its name is never vanishing,\nIt heeds the good of everything."\n\nThrough what do I know that "it heeds the good of everything"? In this way, verily: Through IT.'},{chapter:22,content:'"The crooked shall be straight,\nCrushed ones recuperate,\nThe empty find their fill.\nThe worn with strength shall thrill;\nWho little have receive,\nAnd who have much will grieve."\n\nTherefore\n\nThe holy man embraces unity and becomes for all the world a model.\n\nNot self-displaying he is enlightened;\n\nNot self -approving he is distinguished;\n\nNot self-asserting he acquires merit;\n\nNot self-seeking he gaineth life.\n\nSince he does not quarrel, therefore no one in the world can quarrel with him.\n\nThe saying of the ancients: "The crooked shall be straight," is it in any way vainly spoken? Verily, they will be straightened and return home.'},{chapter:23,content:'To be taciturn is the natural way. A hurricane: does not outlast the morning. A cloudburst does not outlast the day.\n\nWho causes these events but heaven and earth? If even heaven and earth cannot be unremitting, will not man be much less so?\n\nThose who pursue their business in Reason, men of Reason, associate in Reason. Those who pursue their business in virtue associate in virtue. Those who pursue their business in ill luck associate in ill luck. When men associate in Reason, Reason makes them glad to find companions. When men associate in virtue, virtue makes them glad to find companions. When men associate in ill luck, ill luck makes them glad to find companions.\n\n"If your faith is insufficient, verily shall ye receive no faith."'},{chapter:24,content:"One on tiptoe is not steady;\nOne astride makes no advance.\nSeff-displayers are not enlightened,\nSelf-asserters lack distinction,\nSelf-approvers have no merit,\nAnd self-seekers stunt their lives.\n\nBefore Reason this is like surfeit of food; it is like a wen on the body with which people are apt to be disgusted.\n\nTherefore the man of reason will not indulge in it."},{chapter:25,content:"There is a Being wondrous and complete. Before heaven and earth, it was. How calm it is! How spiritual!\n\nAlone it standeth, and it changeth not; around it moveth, and it suffereth not; yet therefore can it be the world's mother.\n\nIts name I know not, but its nature I call Reason.\n\nConstrained to give a name, I call it the great. The great I call the departing, and the departing I call the beyond. The beyond I call home.\n\nThe saying goes: \"Reason is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and royalty also is great.[There are four things in the world that are great, and royalty is one of them.]\n\nMan's standard is the earth. The earth's standard is heaven. Heaven's standard is Reason. Reason's standard is intrinsic."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is of the light the root, and rest is motion's master.\n\nTherefore the holy man in his daily walk does not depart from gravity. Although he may have magnificent sights, he calmly sits with liberated mind.\n\nBut how is it when the master of the ten thousand chariots in his personal conduct is too light for the empire? If he is too light he will lose his vassals. If he is too passionate he will lose the throne."},{chapter:27,content:'"Good travelers leave no trace nor track,\nGood speakers, in logic show no lack,\nGood counters need no counting rack.\n\n"Good lockers bolting bars need not,\nYet none their locks can loose.\nGood binders need no string nor knot,\nYet none unties their noose."\n\nTherefore the holy man is always a good saviour of men, for there are no outcast people. He is always a good saviour of things, for there are no outcast things. This is called applied enlightenment.\n\nThus the good man does not respect multitudes of men. The bad man respects the people\'s wealth. Who does not esteem multitudes nor is charmed by their wealth, though his knowledge be greatly confused, he must be recognized as profoundly spiritual.'},{chapter:28,content:"\"Who his manhood shows\nAnd his womanhood knows\nBecomes the empire's river.\nIs he the empire's river,\nHe will from virtue never deviate,\nAnd home he turneth to a child's estate.\n\n\"Who his brightness shows\nAnd his blackness knows\nBecomes the empire's model.\nIs he the empire's model,\nOf virtue ne'er shall he be destitute,\nAnd home he turneth to the absolute.\n\n\"Who knows his fame\nAnd guards his shame\nBecomes the empire's valley.\nIs he the empire's valley,\nFor e'er his virtue will sufficient be,\nAnd home he turneth to simplicity.\"\n\nSimplicity, when scattered, becomes a vessel of usefulness. The holy man, by using it, becomes the chief leader; and truly, a great principle will never do harm."},{chapter:29,content:'When one desires to take in hand the empire and make it, I see him not succeed. The empire is a divine vessel which cannot be made. One who makes it, mars it. One who takes it, loses it.\n\nAnd it is said of beings:\n"Some are obsequious, others move boldly,\nSome breathe warmly, others coldly,\nSome are strong and others weak,\nSome rise proudly, others sneak."\n\nTherefore the holy man abandons excess, he abandons extravagance, he abandons indulgence.'},{chapter:30,content:"He who with Reason assists the master of mankind will not with arms strengthen the empire. His methods invite requital.\n\nWhere armies are quartered briars and thorns grow. Great wars unfailingly are followed by famines. A good man acts resolutely and then stops. He ventures not to take by force.\n\nBe resolute but not boastful; resolute but not haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute because you cannot avoid it; resolute but not violent.\n\nThings thrive and then grow old. This is called un-Reason. Un-Reason soon ceases."},{chapter:31,content:"Even victorious arms are unblest among tools, and people had better shun them. Therefore he who has Reason does not rely on them.\n\nThe superior man when residing at home honors the left. When using arms, he honors the right.\n\nArms are unblest among tools and not the superior man's tools. Only when it is unavoidable he uses them. Peace and quietude he holdeth high.\n\nHe conquers but rejoices not. Rejoicing at a conquest means to enjoy the slaughter of men. He who enjoys the slaughter of men will most assuredly not obtain his will in the empire."},{chapter:32,content:"Reason, in its eternal aspect, is unnamable.\n\nAlthough its simplicity seems insignificant, the whole world does not dare to suppress it. If princes and kings could keep it, the ten thousand things would of themselves pay homage. Heaven and earth would unite in dripping sweet dew, and the people with no one to command them would of themselves be righteous.\n\nAs soon as Reason creates order, it becomes namable. Whenever the namable in its turn acquires existence, one learns to know when to stop. By knowing when to stop, one avoids danger.\n\nTo illustrate Reason's relation to the world we compare it to streams and creeks in their course towards rivers and the ocean."},{chapter:33,content:"One who knows others is clever, but one who knows himself is enlightened.\n\nOne who conquers others is powerful, but one who conquers himself is mighty.\n\nOne who knows contentment is rich and one who pushes with vigor has will.\n\nOne who loses not his place endures.\n\nOne who may die but will not perish, has life everlasting."},{chapter:34,content:"How all-pervading is the great Reason! It can be on the left and it can be on the right.\n\nThe ten thousand things depend upon it for their life, and it refuses them not. When its merit is accomplished it assumes not the name. Lovingly it nourishes the ten thousand things and plays not the lord. Ever desireless it can be classed with the small. The ten thousand things return home to it. It plays not the lord. It can be classed with the great.\n\nTherefore\n\nThe holy man unto death does not make himself great and can thus accomplish his greatness."},{chapter:35,content:'"Who holdeth fast to the great Form,\nOf him the world will come in quest:\nFor there we never meet with harm,\nThere we find shelter, comfort, rest."\n\nMusic with dainties makes the passing stranger stop. But Reason, when coming from the mouth, how tasteless is it! It has no flavor. When looked at, there is not enough to be seen; when listened to, there is not enough to be heard. However, when used, it is inexhaustible.'},{chapter:36,content:"That which is about to contract has surely been expanded. That which is about to weaken has surely been strengthened. That which is about to fall has surely been raised. That which is about to be despoiled has surely been endowed.\n\nThis is an explanation of the secret that the tender and the weak conquer the hard and the strong.\n\nAs the fish should not escape from the deep, so with the country's sharp tools the people should not become acquainted."},{chapter:37,content:'Reason always practises non-assertion, and there is nothing that remains undone.\n\nIf princes and kings could keep Reason, the ten thousand creatures would of themselves be reformed. While being reformed they might yet be anxious to stir; but I would restrain them by the simplicity of the Ineffable.\n\n"The simplicity of the unexpressed\nWill purify the heart of lust.\nIs there no lust there will be rest,\nAnd all the world will thus be blest."'},{chapter:38,content:"Superior virtue is unvirtue. Therefore it has virtue. Inferior virtue never loses sight of virtue. Therefore it has no virtue.\n\nSuperior virtue is non-assertion and without pretension. Inferior virtue asserts and makes pretensions.\n\nSuperior benevolence acts but makes no pretensions. Superior justice acts and makes pretensions.\n\nSuperior propriety acts and when no one responds to it, it stretches its arm and enforces its rules.\n\nThus one loses Reason and then virtue appears. One loses virtue and then benevolence appears. One loses benevolence and then justice appears. One loses justice and then propriety appears. The rules of propriety are the semblance of loyalty and faith, and the beginning of disorder.\n\nTraditionalism is the flower of Reason, but of ignorance the beginning.\n\nTherefore a great organizer abides by the solid and dwells not in the external. He abides in the fruit and dwells not in the flower.\n\nTherefore he discards the latter and chooses the former."},{chapter:39,content:'From of old these things have obtained oneness:\n\n"Heaven by oneness becometh pure.\nEarth by oneness can endure.\nMinds by oneness souls procure.\nValleys by oneness repletion secure.\n"All creatures by oneness to life have been called.\nAnd kings were by oneness as models installed."\n\nSuch is the result of oneness.\n\n"Were heaven not pure it might be rent.\nWere earth not stable it might be bent.\nWere minds not ensouled they\'d be impotent.\nWere valleys not filled they\'d soon be spent.\nWhen creatures are lifeless who can their death prevent?\nAre kings not models, but on haughtiness bent,\nTheir fall, forsooth, is imminent."\n\nThus, the nobles come from the commoners as their root, and the high rest upon the lowly as their foundation.

He will diminish and continue to diminish until he arrives at non-assertion.\n\nWith non-assertion there is nothing that he cannot achieve. When he takes the empire, it is always because he uses no diplomacy. He who uses diplomacy is not fit to take the empire."},{chapter:49,content:"The holy man has not a heart of his own. The hundred families' hearts he makes his heart.\n\nThe good I meet with goodness; the bad I also meet with goodness; that is virtue's goodness. The faithful I meet with faith; the faithless I also meet with faith; that is virtue's faith.\n\nThe holy man dwells in the world anxious, very anxious in his dealings with the world. He universalizes his heart, and the hundred families fix upon him their ears and eyes. The holy man treats them all like children."},{chapter:50,content:"Abroad in life, home in death.\n\nThere are thirteen avenues of life; there are thirteen avenues of death; on thirteen avenues men that live pass unto the realm of death.\n\nNow, what is the reason? It is because they live life's intensity.\n\nYea, I understand that one whose life is based on goodness, when traveling on land will not fall a prey to the rhinoceros or the tiger. When coming among soldiers, he need not fear arms and weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place wherein to insert its horn. The tiger finds no place wherein to put his claws. Weapons find no place wherein to thrust their blades. The reason is that he does not belong to the realm of death."},{chapter:51,content:"Reason quickens all creatures. Virtue feeds them. Reality shapes them. The forces complete them. Therefore among the ten thousand things there is none that does not esteem Reason and honor virtue.\n\nSince the esteem of Reason and the honoring of virtue is by no one commanded, it is forever spontaneous.\n\nTherefore it is said that Reason quickens all creatures, while virtue feeds them, raises them, nurtures them, completes them, matures them, rears them, and protects them.\n\nTo quicken but not to own, to make but not to claim, to raise but not to rule, this is called profound virtue."},{chapter:52,content:"When the world takes its beginning, Reason becomes the world's mother.\n\nAs one knows his mother, so she in turn knows her child; as she quickens her child, so he in turn keeps to his mother, and to the end of life he is not in danger. Who closes his mouth, and shuts his sense-gates, in the end of life he will encounter no trouble; but who opens his mouth and meddles with affairs, in the end of life he cannot be saved.\n\nWho beholds his smallness is called enlightened.

Through IT.\n\nThe more restrictions and prohibitions are in the empire, the poorer grow the people. The more weapons the people have, the more troubled is the state. The more there is cunning and skill, the more startling events will happen. The more mandates and laws are enacted, the more there will be thieves and robbers.\n\nTherefore the holy man says: I practise non-assertion, and the people of themselves reform. I love quietude, and the people of themselves become righteous. I use no diplomacy, and the people of themselves become rich. I have no desire, and the people of themselves remain simple."},{chapter:58,content:"Whose government is unostentatious, quite unostentatious, his people will be prosperous, quite prosperous. Whose government is prying, quite prying, his people will be needy, quite needy.\n\nMisery, alas! rests upon happiness. Happiness, alas! underlies misery. But who foresees the catastrophe? It will not be prevented!\n\nWhat is ordinary becomes again extraordinary. What is good becomes again unpropitious. This bewilders people, and it happens constantly since times immemorial.\n\nTherefore the holy man is square but not sharp, strict but not obnoxious, upright but not restraining, bright but not dazzling."},{chapter:59,content:"To govern the people is the affair of heaven and there is nothing like thrift.\n\nNow consider that thrift is said to come from early practice.\n\nBy early practice it is said that we can accumulate an abundance of virtue. If one accumulates an abundance of virtue then there is nothing that can not be overcome.\n\nWhen nothing can not be overcome then no one knows his limit. When no one knows his limit one can have possession of the commonwealth.\n\nWho has possession of the commonwealth's mother [thrift] may last and abide.\n\nThis is called the possession of deep roots and of a staunch stem. To life, to everlastingness, to comprehension, this is the way."},{chapter:60,content:"Govern a great country as you would fry small fish: [neither gut nor scale them.]\n\nIf with Reason the empire is managed, its ghosts will not spook. Not only will its ghosts not spook, but its gods will not harm the people. Not only will its gods not harm the people, but neither will its holy men harm the people. Since neither will do harm, therefore their virtues will be combined."},{chapter:61,content:"A great state, one that lowly flows, becomes the empire's union, and the empire's wife.\n\nThe wife always through quietude conquers her husband, and by quietude renders herself lowly.\n\nThus a great state through lowliness toward small states will conquer the small states, and small states through lowliness toward great states will conquer great states.\n\nTherefore some render themselves lowly for the purpose of conquering; others are lowly and therefore conquer.\n\nA great state desires no more than to unite and feed the people; a small state desires no more than to devote itself to the service of the people; but that both may obtain their wishes, the greater one must stoop."},{chapter:62,content:"The man of Reason is the ten thousand creatures' refuge, the good man's wealth, the bad man's stay.\n\nWith beautiful words one can sell. With honest conduct one can do still more with the people.\n\nIf a man be bad, why should he be thrown away? Therefore, an emperor was elected and three ministers appointed; but better than holding before one's face the jade table [of the ministry] and riding with four horses, is sitting still and propounding the eternal Reason.\n\nWhy do the ancients prize this Reason? Is it not, say, because when sought it is obtained and the sinner thereby can be saved? Therefore it is world-honored."},{chapter:63,content:"Assert non-assertion.\n\nPractise non-practice.\n\nTaste the tasteless.\n\nMake great the small.\n\nMake much the little.\n\nRequite hatred with virtue.\n\nContemplate a difficulty when it is easy. Manage a great thing when it is small.\n\nThe world's most difficult undertakings necessarily originate while easy, and the world's greatest undertakings necessarily originate while small.\n\nTherefore the holy man to the end does not venture to play the great, and thus he can accomplish his greatness.\n\nRash promises surely lack faith, and many easy things surely involve in many difficulties.\n\nTherefore, the holy man regards everything as difficult, and thus to the end encounters no difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"What is still at rest is easily kept quiet. What has not as yet appeared is easily prevented. What is still feeble is easily broken. What is still scant is easily dispersed.\n\nTreat things before they exist. Regulate things before disorder begins. The stout tree has originated from a tiny rootlet. A tower of nine stories is raised by heaping up [bricks of] clay. A thousand miles' journey begins with a foot.\n\nHe that makes mars. He that grasps loses.\n\nThe holy man does not make; therefore he mars not. He does not grasp; therefore he loses not. The people when undertaking an enterprise are always near completion, and yet they fail.\n\nRemain careful to the end as in the beginning and you will not fail in your enterprise.\n\nTherefore the holy man desires to be desireless, and does not prize articles difficult to obtain. He learns, not to be learned, and seeks a home where multitudes of people pass by.\n\nHe assists the ten thousand things in their natural development, but he does not venture to interfere."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancients who were well versed in Reason did not thereby enlighten the people; they intended thereby to make them simple-hearted.\n\nIf people are difficult to govern, it is because they are too smart. To govern the country with smartness is the country's curse. To govern the country without smartness is the country's blessing. He who knows these two things is also a model [like the ancients]. Always to know the model is called profound virtue.\n\nSpiritual virtue, verily, is profound. Verily, it is far-reaching. Verily, it is to everything reverse. But then it will procure great recognition."},{chapter:66,content:"That rivers and oceans can of the hundred valleys be kings is due to their excelling in lowliness. Thus they can of the hundred valleys be the kings.\n\nTherefore the holy man, when anxious to be above the people, must in his words keep underneath them. When anxious to lead the people, he must with his person keep behind them.\n\nTherefore the holy man dwells above, but the people are not burdened. He is ahead, but the people suffer no harm.\n\nTherefore the world rejoices in exalting him and does not tire. Because he strives not, no one in the world will strive with him."},{chapter:67,content:"All in the world call me great; but I resemble the unlikely. Now a man is great only because he resembles the unlikely. Did he resemble the likely, how lasting, indeed, would his mediocrity be!\n\nI have three treasures which I cherish and prize. The first is called compassion. The second is called economy. The third is called not daring to come to the front in the world.\n\nThe compassionate can be brave; the economical can be generous; those who dare not come to the front in the world can become perfect as chief vessels.\n\nNow, if people discard compassion and are brave; if they discard economy and are generous; if they discard modesty and are ambitious, they will surely die.\n\nNow, the compassionate will in attack be victorious, and in defence firm. Heaven when about to save one will with compassion protect him."},{chapter:68,content:"He who excels as a warrior is not warlike. He who excels as a fighter is not wrathful. He who excels in conquering the enemy does not strive. He who excels in employing men is lowly.\n\nThis is called the virtue of not-striving. This is called utilizing men's ability. This is called complying with heaven-since olden times the highest."},{chapter:69,content:"A military expert used to say: 'I dare not act as host [who takes the initiative] but act as guest [with reserve]. I dare not advance an inch, but I withdraw a foot.\"\n\nThis is called marching without marching, threatening without arms, charging without hostility, seizing without weapons.\n\nNo greater misfortune than making light of the enemy! When we make light of the enemy, it is almost as though we had lost our treasure--[compassion].\n\nThus, if matched armies encounter one another, the one who does so in sorrow is sure to conquer."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practise, but in the world no one can understand, no one can practise them.\n\nWords have an ancestor; Deeds have a master [viz., Reason]. Since he is not understood, therefore I am not understood. Those who understand me are few, and thus I am distinguished.\n\nTherefore the holy man wears wool, and hides in his bosom his jewels."},{chapter:71,content:"To know the unknowable, that is elevating. Not to know the knowable, that is sickness.\n\nOnly by becoming sick of sickness can we be without sickness.\n\nThe holy man is not sick. Because he is sick of sickness, therefore he is not sick."},{chapter:72,content:"If the people do not fear the dreadful, the great dreadful will come, surely.\n\nLet them not deem their lives narrow. Let them not deem their lot wearisome. When it is not deemed wearisome, then it will not be wearisome.\n\nTherefore the holy man knows himself but does not display himself. He holds himself dear but does not honor himself. Thus he discards the latter and chooses the former."},{chapter:73,content:'Courage, if carried to daring, leads to death; courage, if not carried to daring, leads to life. Either of these two things is sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful.\n\n"Why \u2019t is by heaven rejected,\nWho has the reason detected?"\n\nTherefore the holy man also regards it as difficult.\n\nThe Heavenly Reason strives not, but it is sure to conquer. It speaks not, but it is sure to respond. It summons not, but it comes of itself. It works patiently, but is sure in its designs.\n\nHeaven\'s net is vast, so vast. It is wide-meshed, but it loses nothing.'},{chapter:74,content:"If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by death? If we make people fear death, and supposing some would [still] venture to rebel, if we seize them for capital punishment, who will dare?\n\nThere is always an executioner who kills. Now to take the place of the executioner who kills is taking the place of the great carpenter who hews. If a man takes the place of the great carpenter who hews, he will rarely, indeed, fail to injure his hand."},{chapter:75,content:"The people hunger because their superiors consume too many taxes; therefore they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors are too meddlesome; therefore they are difficult to govern. The people make light of death on account of the intensity of their clinging to life; therefore they make light of death.\n\nHe who is not bent on life is worthier than he who esteems life."},{chapter:76,content:"Man during life is tender and delicate. When he dies he is stiff and stark.\n\nThe ten thousand things, the grass as well as the trees, while they live are tender and supple. When they die they are rigid and dry.\n\nThus the hard and the strong are the companions of death. The tender and the delicate are the companions of life.\n\nTherefore he who in arms is strong will not conquer.\n\nWhen a tree has grown strong it is doomed.\n\nThe strong and the great stay below. The tender and the delicate stay above."},{chapter:77,content:"Is not Heaven's Reason truly like stretching a bow? The high it brings down, the lowly it lifts up. Those who have abundance it depleteth; those who are deficient it augmenteth.\n\nSuch is Heaven's Reason. It depleteth those who have abundance but completeth the deficient.\n\nMan's Reason is not so. He depleteth the deficient in order to serve those who have abundance.\n\nWhere is he who would have abundance for serving the world?\n\nIndeed, it is the holy man who acts but claims not; merit he acquires but he does not dwell upon it, and does he ever show any anxiety to display his excellence?"},{chapter:78,content:"In the world nothing is tenderer and more delicate than water. In attacking the hard and the strong nothing will surpass it. There is nothing that herein takes its place.\n\nThe weak conquer the strong, the tender conquer the rigid. In the world there is no one who does not know it, but no one will practise it.\n\nTherefore the holy man says:\n\n\"Him who the country's sin makes his,\nWe hail as priest at the great sacrifice.\nHim who the curse bears of the country's failing.\nAs king of the empire we are hailing.\"\n\nTrue words seem paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When a great hatred is reconciled, naturally some hatred will remain. How can this be made good?\n\nTherefore the sage keeps the obligations of his contract and exacts not from others. Those who have virtue attend to their obligations; those who have no virtue attend to their claims.\n\nHeaven's Reason shows no preference but always assists the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"In a small country with few people let there be aldermen and mayors who are possessed of power over men but would not use it. Induce people to grieve at death but do not cause them to move to a distance. Although they had ships and carriages, they should find no occasion to ride in them. Although they had armours and weapons, they should find no occasion to don them.\n\nInduce people to return to [the old custom of] knotted cords and to use them [in the place of writing], to delight in their food, to be proud of their clothes, to be content with their homes, and to rejoice in their customs: then in a neighboring state within sight, the voices of the cocks and dogs would be within hearing, yet the people might grow old and die before they visited one another."},{chapter:81,content:"True words are not pleasant; pleasant words are not true. The good are not contentious; the contentious are not good. The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\n\nThe holy man hoards not. The more he does for others, the more he owns himself. The more he gives to others, the more will he himself lay up an abundance.\n\nHeaven's Reason is to benefit but not to injure; the holy man's Reason is to accomplish but not to strive."}]},{name:"James Legge",date:1891,component:[{chapter:1,content:"The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and\nunchanging Tao.

Making an effort (further) to give it a name I\ncall it The Great.\n\nGreat, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes\nremote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is\ngreat; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also\ngreat. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage)\nking is one of them.\n\nMan takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from\nHeaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its\nbeing what it is."},{chapter:26,content:"Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of\nmovement.\n\nTherefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far\nfrom his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to\nlook at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to\nthem. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly\nbefore the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of\ngravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne."},{chapter:27,content:"The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or\nfootsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault\nwith or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful\ncloser needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be\nimpossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to\nunloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the\nsage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any\nman; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast\naway anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.'\n\nTherefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him\nwho has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of\n(the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour\nhis master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an\n(observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is\ncalled 'The utmost degree of mystery.'"},{chapter:28,content:"Who knows his manhood's strength,\nYet still his female feebleness maintains;\nAs to one channel flow the many drains,\nAll come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.\nThus he the constant excellence retains;\nThe simple child again, free from all stains.\n\nWho knows how white attracts,\nYet always keeps himself within black's shade,\nThe pattern of humility displayed,\nDisplayed in view of all beneath the sky;\nHe in the unchanging excellence arrayed,\nEndless return to man's first state has made.\n\nWho knows how glory shines,\nYet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;\nBehold his presence in a spacious vale,\nTo which men come from all beneath the sky.\nThe unchanging excellence completes its tale;\nThe simple infant man in him we hail.\n\nThe unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms\nvessels.

The\nkingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He\nwho would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp\nloses it.\n\nThe course and nature of things is such that\nWhat was in front is now behind;\nWhat warmed anon we freezing find.\nStrength is of weakness oft the spoil;\nThe store in ruins mocks our toil.\n\nHence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy\nindulgence."},{chapter:30,content:"He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will\nnot assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course\nis sure to meet with its proper return.\n\nWherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the\nsequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years.\n\nA skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does\nnot dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his\nmastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against\nbeing vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes\nit as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for\nmastery.\n\nWhen things have attained their strong maturity they become old.\nThis may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not\nin accordance with it soon comes to an end."},{chapter:31,content:"Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen,\nhateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have\nthe Tao do not like to employ them.\n\nThe superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most\nhonourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp\nweapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the\nsuperior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm\nand repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him\nundesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the\nslaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot\nget his will in the kingdom.\n\nOn occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized\nposition; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in\ncommand of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding\nin chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him\nas in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men\nshould weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in\nbattle has his place (rightly) according to those rites."},{chapter:32,content:"The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name.\n\nThough in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole\nworld dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a\nfeudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would\nspontaneously submit themselves to him.\n\nHeaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down\nthe sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally\neverywhere as of its own accord.\n\nAs soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has\nthat name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in\nit, they can be free from all risk of failure and error.\n\nThe relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great\nrivers and seas to the streams from the valleys."},{chapter:33,content:"He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is\nintelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes\nhimself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who\ngoes on acting with energy has a (firm) will.\n\nHe who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues\nlong; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity."},{chapter:34,content:"All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left\nhand and on the right.\n\nAll things depend on it for their production, which it gives to\nthem, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is\naccomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It\nclothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being\ntheir lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things\nreturn (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it\nwhich presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest\nthings.\n\nHence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great\nachievements.

(Those who) possessed in a lower degree those\nattributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not\npossess them (in fullest measure).\n\n(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did\nnothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who)\npossessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to\nbe so doing.\n\n(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking)\nto carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who)\npossessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it\nout, and had need to be so doing.\n\n(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always\nseeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared\nthe arm and marched up to them.\n\nThus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared;\nwhen its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence\nwas lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the\nproprieties appeared.\n\nNow propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good\nfaith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is\n(only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity.\n\nThus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews\nwhat is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is\nthus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other."},{chapter:39,content:"The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are--\n\nHeaven which by it is bright and pure;\nEarth rendered thereby firm and sure;\nSpirits with powers by it supplied;\nValleys kept full throughout their void\nAll creatures which through it do live\nPrinces and kings who from it get\nThe model which to all they give.\n\nAll these are the results of the One (Tao).\n\nIf heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;\nIf earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;\nWithout these powers, the spirits soon would fail;\nIf not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;\nWithout that life, creatures would pass away;\nPrinces and kings, without that moral sway,\nHowever grand and high, would all decay.\n\nThus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous)\nmeanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from\nwhich it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,'\n'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this\nan acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see\nthe foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of\nthe different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it\nanswer the ends of a carriage.

Stillness may be considered (a\nsort of) abasement.\n\nThus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states,\ngains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to\na great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement\nleads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour.\n\nThe great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them;\na small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.\nEach gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase\nitself."},{chapter:62,content:"Tao has of all things the most honoured place.\nNo treasures give good men so rich a grace;\nBad men it guards, and doth their ill efface.\n\n(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds\ncan raise their performer above others.

Was it not\nbecause it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape\n(from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all\nunder heaven consider it the most valuable thing."},{chapter:63,content:"(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting;\nto conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste\nwithout discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great,\nand a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.\n\n(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they\nare easy, and does things that would become great while they are\nsmall. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a\nprevious state in which they were easy, and all great things from one\nin which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does\nwhat is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest\nthings.\n\nHe who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is\ncontinually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.\nTherefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so\nnever has any difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing\nhas given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures\nagainst it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very\nsmall is easily dispersed.

(But) people in their conduct of\naffairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of\nsuccess. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the\nbeginning, they would not so ruin them.\n\nTherefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does\nnot prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not\nlearn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by.\nThus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare\nto act (with an ulterior purpose of his own)."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did\nso, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and\nignorant.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people arises from their having\nmuch knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a\nscourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing.\n\nHe who knows these two things finds in them also his model and\nrule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call\nthe mysterious excellence (of a governor).

So it is\nthat the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his\nwords below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person\nbehind them.\n\nIn this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his\nweight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an\ninjury to them.\n\nTherefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of\nhim. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive\nwith him."},{chapter:67,content:"All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears\nto be inferior (to other systems of teaching). Now it is just its\ngreatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any\nother (system), for long would its smallness have been known!\n\nBut I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The\nfirst is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking\nfrom taking precedence of others.\n\nWith that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be\nliberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a\nvessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and\nare all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the\nhindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end\nis) death.\n\nGentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to\nmaintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very)\ngentleness protecting him."},{chapter:68,content:"He who in (Tao's) wars has skill\nAssumes no martial port;\nHe who fights with most good will\nTo rage makes no resort.\nHe who vanquishes yet still\nKeeps from his foes apart;\nHe whose hests men most fulfil\nYet humbly plies his art.\n\nThus we say, 'He ne'er contends,\nAnd therein is his might.'\nThus we say, 'Men's wills he bends,\nThat they with him unite.'\nThus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends,\nNo sage of old more bright.'"},{chapter:69,content:"A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the\nhost (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the\ndefensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a\nfoot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks;\nbaring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping\nthe weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the\nenemy where there is no enemy.\n\nThere is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do\nthat is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is\nthat when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores\n(the situation) conquers."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but\nthere is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise\nthem.\n\nThere is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my\nwords, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It\nis because they do not know these, that men do not know me.\n\nThey who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be\nprized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth,\nwhile he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom."},{chapter:71,content:"To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest\n(attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease.\n\nIt is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this\ndisease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease.\nHe knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he\ndoes not have it."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which\nis their great dread will come on them.\n\nLet them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary\nlife; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on.\n\nIt is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not\narise.\n\nTherefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not\nparade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value\non, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes\nchoice of the former."},{chapter:73,content:"He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in\ndefiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in\nhis not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one\nappears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But\n\nWhen Heaven's anger smites a man,\nWho the cause shall truly scan?\n\nOn this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the\nformer case).\n\nIt is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully\novercomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply;\ndoes not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its\ndemonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective.\nThe meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting\nnothing escape."},{chapter:74,content:"The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to)\nfrighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death,\nand I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death,\nwho would dare to do wrong?\n\nThere is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who\nwould inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be\ndescribed as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it\nthat he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter,\ndoes not cut his own hands!"},{chapter:75,content:"The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes\nconsumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer\nfamine.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive)\nagency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this\nthat they are difficult to govern.\n\nThe people make light of dying because of the greatness of their\nlabours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes\nthem think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of\nliving altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on\nit."},{chapter:76,content:"Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and\nstrong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early\ngrowth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.\n\nThus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of\ndeath; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.\n\nHence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not\nconquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms,\n(and thereby invites the feller.)\n\nTherefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that\nof what is soft and weak is above."},{chapter:77,content:"May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method\n\nof) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought\nlow, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where\nthere is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency.\n\nIt is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to\nsupplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes\naway from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.\n\nWho can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under\nheaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!\n\nTherefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as\nhis; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he\ndoes not wish to display his superiority."},{chapter:78,content:"There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water,\nand yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing\nthat can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual)\nfor which it can be changed.\n\nEvery one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and\nthe weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.\n\nTherefore a sage has said,\n'He who accepts his state's reproach,\nIs hailed therefore its altars' lord;\nTo him who bears men's direful woes\nThey all the name of King accord.'\n\nWords that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a\ngreat animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind\nof the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the\nother)?\n\nTherefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand\nportion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the\n(speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the\nattributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the\nengagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the\nconditions favourable to himself.\n\nIn the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always\non the side of the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"In a little state with a small population, I would so order it,\nthat, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a\nhundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the\npeople, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove\nelsewhere (to avoid it).\n\nThough they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion\nto ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they\nshould have no occasion to don or use them.\n\nI would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead\nof the written characters).\n\nThey should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes\nbeautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common\n(simple) ways sources of enjoyment.\n\nThere should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices\nof the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I\nwould make the people to old age, even to death, not have any\nintercourse with it."},{chapter:81,content:"Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those\nwho are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the\ndisputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not\nextensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he\nexpends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that\nhe gives to others, the more does he have himself.\n\nWith all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with\nall the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive."}]},{name:"Dwight Goddard",date:1919,component:[{chapter:1,content:"The Tao that can be understood cannot be the primal, or cosmic, Tao, just as an idea that can be expressed in words cannot be the infinite idea.\n\nAnd yet this ineffable Tao was the source of all spirit and matter, and being expressed was the mother of all created things.\n\nTherefore not to desire the things of sense is to know the freedom of spirituality; and to desire is to learn the limitation of matter. These two things spirit and matter, so different in nature, have the same origin. This unity of origin is the mystery of mysteries, but it is the gateway to spirituality."},{chapter:2,content:"When every one recognizes beauty to be only a masquerade, then it is simply ugliness. In the same way goodness, if it is not sincere, is not goodness. So existence and non-existence are incompatible. The difficult and easy are mutually opposites. Just as the long and the short, the high and the low, the loud and soft, the before and the behind, are all opposites and each reveals the other.\n\nTherefore the wise man is not conspicuous in his affairs or given to much talking. Though troubles arise he is not irritated. He produces but does not own; he acts but claims no merit; he builds but does not dwell therein; and because he does not dwell therein he never departs."},{chapter:3,content:"Neglecting to praise the worthy deters people from emulating them; just as not prizing rare treasures deters a man from becoming a thief; or ignoring the things which awaken desire keeps the heart at rest.\n\nTherefore the wise ruler does not suggest unnecessary things, but seeks to satisfy the minds of his people. He seeks to allay appetites but strengthen bones. He ever tries by keeping people in ignorance to keep them satisfied and those who have knowledge he restrains from evil. If he, himself, practices restraint then everything is in quietness."},{chapter:4,content:"The Tao appears to be emptiness but it is never exhausted. Oh, it is profound! It appears to have preceded everything. It dulls its own sharpness, unravels its own fetters, softens its own brightness, identifies itself with its own dust.\n\nOh, it is tranquil! It appears infinite; I do not know from what it proceeds. It even appears to be antecedent to the Lord."},{chapter:5,content:"Heaven and earth are not like humans, they are impartial. They regard all things as insignificant, as though they were playthings made of straw. The wise man is also impartial. To him all men are alike and unimportant. The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows, it is empty but does not collapse; it moves and more and more issues. A gossip is soon empty, it is doubtful if he can be impartial."},{chapter:6,content:"The Spirit of the perennial spring is said to be immortal, she is called the Mysterious One. The Mysterious One is typical of the source of heaven and earth. It is continually and endlessly issuing and without effort."},{chapter:7,content:"Heaven is eternal, earth is lasting. The reason why heaven and earth are eternal and lasting is because they do not live for themselves; that is the reason they will ever endure.\n\nTherefore the wise man will keep his personality out of sight and because of so doing he will become notable. He subordinates his personality and therefore it is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he is disinterested, that his own interests are conserved?"},{chapter:8,content:"True goodness is like water, in that it benefits everything and harms nothing. Like water it ever seeks the lowest place, the place that all others avoid. It is closely kin to the Tao.\n\nFor a dwelling it chooses the quiet meadow; for a heart the circling eddy. In generosity it is kind; in speech it is sincere; in authority it is order; in affairs it is ability; in movement it is rhythm.\n\nInasmuch as it is always peaceable it is never rebuked."},{chapter:9,content:"Continuing to fill a pail after it is full the water will be wasted. Continuing to grind an axe after it is sharp will soon wear it away.\n\nWho can protect a public hall crowded with gold and jewels? The pride of wealth and position brings about their own misfortune. To win true merit, to preserve just fame, the personality must be retiring. This is the heavenly Tao."},{chapter:10,content:"By patience the animal spirits can be disciplined. By self-control one can unify the character. By close attention to the will, compelling gentleness, one can become like a little child. By purifying the subconscious desires one may be without fault. In ruling his country, if the wise magistrate loves his people, he can avoid compulsion.\n\nIn measuring out rewards, the wise magistrate will act like a mother bird. While sharply penetrating into every corner, he may appear to be unsuspecting. While quickening and feeding his people, he will be producing but without pride of ownership. He will benefit but without claim of reward. He will persuade, but not compel by force. This is teh, the profoundest virtue."},{chapter:11,content:"Although the wheel has thirty spokes its utility lies in the emptiness of the hub. The jar is made by kneading clay, but its usefulness consists in its capacity. A room is made by cutting out windows and doors through the walls, but the space the walls contain measures the room's value.\n\nIn the same way matter is necessary to form, but the value of reality lies in its immateriality.\n\n(Or thus: a material body is necessary to existence, but the value of a life is measured by its immaterial soul.)"},{chapter:12,content:"An excess of light blinds the human eye; an excess of noise ruins the ear; an excess of condiments deadens the taste. The effect of too much horse racing and hunting is bad, and the lure of hidden treasure tempts one to do evil.\n\nTherefore the wise man attends to the inner significance of things and does not concern himself with outward appearances. Therefore he ignores matter and seeks the spirit."},{chapter:13,content:"Favor and disgrace are alike to be feared, just as too great care or anxiety are bad for the body.\n\nWhy are favor and disgrace alike to be feared? To be favored is humiliating; to obtain it is as much to be dreaded as to lose it. To lose favor is to be in disgrace and of course is to be dreaded.\n\nWhy are excessive care and great anxiety alike bad for one? The very reason I have anxiety is because I have a body. If I have not body why would I be anxious?\n\nTherefore if he who administers the empire, esteems it as his own body, then he is worthy to be trusted with the empire."},{chapter:14,content:"It is unseen because it is colorless; it is unheard because it is soundless; when seeking to grasp it, it eludes one, because it is incorporeal.\n\nBecause of these qualities it cannot be examined, and yet they form an essential unity. Superficially it appears abstruse, but in its depths it is not obscure. It has been nameless forever! It appears and then disappears. It is what is known as the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. It is called the transcendental, its face (or destiny) cannot be seen in front, or its back (or origin) behind.\n\nBut by holding fast to the Tao of the ancients, the wise man may understand the present, because he knows the origin of the past. This is the clue to the Tao."},{chapter:15,content:"In olden times the ones who were considered worthy to be called masters were subtle, spiritual, profound, wise. Their thoughts could not be easily understood.\n\nSince they were hard to understand I will try to make them clear. They were cautious like men wading a river in winter. They were reluctant like men who feared their neighbors. They were reserved like guests in the presence of their host. They were elusive like ice at the point of melting. They were like unseasoned wood. They were like a valley between high mountains. They were obscure like troubled waters. (They were cautious because they were conscious of the deeper meanings of life and its possibilities.)\n\nWe can clarify troubled waters by slowly quieting them. We can bring the unconscious to life by slowly moving them. But he who has the secret of the Tao does not desire for more. Being content, he is able to mature without desire to be newly fashioned."},{chapter:16,content:"Seek to attain an open mind (the summit of vacuity). Seek composure (the essence of tranquillity).\n\nAll things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquillity; it is moving towards its destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.\n\nKnowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; nobility is like heaven.\n\nThe heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is not to be feared."},{chapter:17,content:"When great men rule, subjects know little of their existence. Rulers who are less great win the affection and praise of their subjects. A common ruler is feared by his subjects, and an unworthy ruler is despised.\n\nWhen a ruler lacks faith, you may seek in vain for it among his subjects.\n\nHow carefully a wise ruler chooses his words. He performs deeds, and accumulates merit! Under such a ruler the people think they are ruling themselves."},{chapter:18,content:"When the great Tao is lost sight of, we still have the idea of benevolence and righteousness. Prudence and wisdom come to mind when we see great hypocrisy. When relatives are! unfriendly, we still have the teachings of filial piety and paternal affection. When the state and the clan are in confusion and disorder, we still have the ideals of loyalty and faithfulness."},{chapter:19,content:"Abandon the show of saintliness and relinquish excessive prudence, then people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon ostentatious benevolence and conspicuous righteousness, then people will return to the primal virtues of filial piety and parental affection. Abandon cleverness and relinquish gains, then thieves and robbers will disappear.\n\nHere are three fundamentals on which to depend, wherein culture is insufficient. Therefore let all men hold to that which is reliable, namely, recognize simplicity, cherish purity, reduce one's possessions, diminish one's desires."},{chapter:20,content:'Avoid learning if you would have no anxiety. The "yes" and the "yea" differ very little, but the contrast between good and evil is very great. That which is not feared by the people is not worth fearing. But, oh, the difference, the desolation, the vastness, between ignorance and the limitless expression of the Tao.\n\n(The balance of this sonnet is devoted to showing the difference between the careless state of the common people and his own vision of the Tao. It is one of the most pathetic expressions of human loneliness, from lack of appreciation, ever written. It is omitted here that it might serve for the closing sonnet and valedictory.)'},{chapter:21,content:"All the innumerable forms of teh correspond to the norm of Tao, but the nature of the Tao's activity is infinitely abstract and illusive. Illusive and obscure, indeed, but at its heart are forms and types. Vague and illusive, indeed, but at its heart is all being. Unfathomable and obscure, indeed, but at its heart is all spirit, and spirit is reality. At its heart is truth.\n\nFrom of old its expression is unceasing, it has been present at all beginnings. How do I know that its nature is thus? By this same Tao."},{chapter:22,content:'At that time the deficient will be made perfect; the distorted will be straightened; the empty will be filled; the worn out will be renewed; those having little will obtain and those having much will be overcome.\n\nTherefore the wise man, embracing unity as he does, will become the world\'s model. Not pushing himself forward he will become enlightened; not asserting himself he will become distinguished; not boasting of himself he will acquire merit; not approving himself he will endure. Forasmuch as he will not quarrel, the world will not quarrel with him.\n\nIs the old saying, "The crooked shall be made straight," a false saying? Indeed, no! They will be perfected and return rejoicing.'},{chapter:23,content:"Taciturnity is natural to man. A whirlwind never outlasts the morning, nor a violent rain the day. What is the cause? It is heaven and earth. If even heaven and earth are not constant, much less can man be.\n\nTherefore he who pursues his affairs in the spirit of Tao will become Tao-like. He who pursues his affairs with teh, will become teh-like. He who pursues his affairs with loss, identifies himself with loss.\n\nHe who identifies himself with Tao, Tao rejoices to guide. He who identifies himself with teh, teh rejoices to reward. And he who identifies himself with loss, loss rejoices to ruin.\n\nIf his faith fail, he will receive no reward of faith."},{chapter:24,content:"It is not natural to stand on tiptoe, or being astride one does not walk. One who displays himself is not bright, or one who asserts himself cannot shine. A self-approving man has no merit, nor does one who praises himself grow.\n\nThe relation of these things (self-display, self-assertion, self-approval) to Tao is the same as offal is to food. They are excrescences from the system; they are detestable; Tao does not dwell in them."},{chapter:25,content:"There is Being that is all-inclusive and that existed before Heaven and Earth. Calm, indeed, and incorporeal! It is alone and changeless!\n\nEverywhere it functions unhindered. It thereby becomes the world's mother. I do not know its nature; if I try to characterize it, I will call it Tao.\n\nIf forced to give it a name, I will call it the Great. The Great is evasive, the evasive is the distant, the distant is ever coming near. Tao is Great. So is Heaven great, and so is Earth and so also is the representative of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMan is derived from nature, nature is derived from Heaven, Heaven is derived from Tao. Tao is self-derived."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is the root of the light; the quiet is master of motion. Therefore the wise man in all the experience of the day will not depart from dignity. Though he be surrounded with sights that are magnificent, he will remain calm and unconcerned.\n\nHow does it come to pass that the Emperor, master of ten thousand chariots, has lost the mastery of the Empire? Because being flippant himself, he has lost the respect of his subjects; being passionate himself, he has lost the control of the Empire."},{chapter:27,content:"Good walkers leave no tracks, good speakers make no errors, good counters need no abacus, good wardens have no need for bolts and locks for no one can get by them. Good binders can dispense with rope and cord, yet none can unloose their hold.\n\nTherefore the wise man trusting in goodness always saves men, for there is no outcast to him. Trusting in goodness he saves all things for there is nothing valueless to him. This is recognizing concealed values.\n\nTherefore the good man is the instructor of the evil man, and the evil man is the good man's wealth. He who does not esteem his instructors or value his wealth, though he be otherwise intelligent, becomes confused. Herein lies the significance of spirituality."},{chapter:28,content:"He who knows his manhood and understands his womanhood becomes useful like the valleys of earth (which bring water). Being like the valleys of earth, eternal vitality (teh) will not depart from him, he will come again to the nature of a little child.\n\nHe who knows his innocence and recognizes his sin becomes the world's model. Being a world's model, infinite teh will not fail, he will return to the Absolute.\n\nHe who knows the glory of his nature and recognizes also his limitations becomes useful like the world's valleys. Being like the world's valleys, eternal teh will not fail him, he will revert to simplicity.\n\nRadiating simplicity he will make of men vessels of usefulness. The wise man then will employ them as officials and chiefs. A great administration of such will harm no one."},{chapter:29,content:"One who desires to take and remake the Empire will fail. The Empire is a divine thing that cannot be remade. He who attempts it will only mar it.\n\nHe who seeks to grasp it, will lose it. People differ, some lead, others follow; some are ardent, others are formal; some are strong, others weak; some succeed, others fail. Therefore the wise man practices moderation; he abandons pleasure, extravagance and indulgence."},{chapter:30,content:"When the magistrate follows Tao, he has no need to resort to force of arms to strengthen the Empire, because his business methods alone will show good returns.\n\nBriars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad harvests are the sequence of a great war. The good ruler will be resolute and then stop, he dare not take by force. One should be resolute but not boastful; resolute but not haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute but yielding when it cannot be avoided; resolute but he must not resort to violence.\n\nBy a resort to force, things flourish for a time but then decay. This is not like the Tao and that which is not Tao-like will soon cease."},{chapter:31,content:"Even successful arms, among all implements, are unblessed. All men come to detest them. Therefore the one who follows Tao does not rely on them. Arms are of all tools unblessed, they are not the implements of a wise man. Only as a last resort does he use them.\n\nPeace and quietude are esteemed by the wise man, and even when victorious he does not rejoice, because rejoicing over a victory is the same as rejoicing over the killing of men. If he rejoices over killing men, do you think he will ever really master the Empire?\n\nIn propitious affairs the place of honor is the left, but in unpropitious affairs we honor the right.\n\nThe strong man while at home esteems the left as the place of honor, but when armed for war it is as though he esteems the right hand, the place of less honor.\n\nThus a funeral ceremony is so arranged. The place of a subordinate army officer is also on the left and the place of his superior officer is on the right. The killing of men fills multitudes with sorrow; we lament with tears because of it, and rightly honor the victor as if he was attending a funeral ceremony."},{chapter:32,content:"Tao in its eternal aspect is unnamable. Its simplicity appears insignificant, but the whole world cannot control it. If princes and kings employ it every one of themselves will pay willing homage. Heaven and Earth by it are harmoniously combined and drop sweet dew. People will have no need of rulers, because of themselves they will be righteous.\n\nAs soon as Tao expresses itself in orderly creation then it becomes comprehensible. When one recognizes the presence of Tao he understands where to stop. Knowing where to stop he is free from danger.\n\nTo illustrate the nature of Tao's place in the universe: Tao is like the brooks and streams in their relation to the great rivers and the ocean."},{chapter:33,content:"He who knows others is intelligent; he who understands himself is enlightened; he who is able to conquer others has force, but he who is able to control himself is mighty. He who appreciates contentment is wealthy.\n\nHe who dares to act has nerve; if he can maintain his position he will endure, but he, who dying does not perish, is immortal."},{chapter:34,content:"Great Tao is all pervading! It can be on both the right hand and the left. Everything relies upon it for their existence, and it does not fail them. It acquires merit but covets not the title. It lovingly nourishes everything, but does not claim the rights of ownership. It has no desires, it can be classed with the small. Everything returns to it, yet it does not claim the right of ownership. It can be classed with the great.\n\nTherefore the wise man to the end will not pose as a great man, and by so doing will express his true greatness."},{chapter:35,content:"The world will go to him who grasps this Great Principle; they will seek and not be injured, they will find contentment, peace and rest.\n\nMusic and dainties attract the passing people, while Tao's reality seen-is insipid. Indeed it has no taste, when looked at there is not enough seen to be prized, when listened for, it can scarcely be heard, but, the use of it is inexhaustible."},{chapter:36,content:"That which has a tendency to contract must first have been extended; that which has a tendency to weaken itself must first have been strong; that which shows a tendency to destroy itself must first have been raised up; that which shows a tendency to scatter must first have been gathered.\n\nThis is the explanation of a seeming contradiction: the tender and yielding conquer the rigid and strong (i.e., spirit is stronger than matter, persuasion than force). The fish would be foolish to seek escape from its natural environment. There is no gain to a nation to compel by a show of force."},{chapter:37,content:"Tao is apparently inactive (wu wei) and yet nothing remains undone. If princes and kings desire to keep) everything in order, they must first reform themselves. (If princes and kings would follow the example of Tao, then all things will reform themselves.) If they still desire to change, I would pacify them by the simplicity of the ineffable Tao.\n\nThis simplicity will end desire, and if desire be absent there is quietness. All people will of themselves be satisfied."},{chapter:38,content:"Essential teh makes no show of virtue, and therefore it is really virtuous. Inferior virtue never loses sight of itself and therefore it is no longer virtue. Essential virtue is characterized by lack of self-assertion (wu wei) and therefore is unpretentious. Inferior virtue is acting a part and thereby is only pretense.\n\nSuperior benevolence in a way is acting but does not thereby become pretentious. Excessive righteousness is acting and does thereby become pretentious. Excessive propriety is acting, but where no one responds to it, it stretches its arm and enforces obedience.\n\nTherefore when one loses Tao there is still teh; one may lose teh and benevolence remains; one may forsake benevolence and still hold to righteousness; one may lose righteousness and propriety remains.\n\nPropriety, alone, reduces loyalty and good faith to a shadow, and it is the beginning of disorder. Tradition is the mere flower of the Tao and had its origin in ignorance.\n\nTherefore the great man of affairs conforms to the spirit and not to external appearance. He goes on to fruitage and does not rest in the show of blossom. He avoids mere propriety and practices true benevolence."},{chapter:39,content:"It has been said of old, only those who attain unity attain self-hood. . . . Heaven attained unity and thereby is space. Earth attained unity, thereby it is solid. Spirit attained unity, thereby it became mind. Valleys attained unity, therefore rivers flow down them. All things have unity and thereby have life. Princes and kings as they attain unity become standards of conduct for the nation. And the highest unity is that which produces unity.\n\nIf heaven were not space it might crack, if earth were not solid it might bend. If spirits were not unified into mind they might vanish, if valleys were not adapted to rivers they would be parched. Everything if it were not for life would burn up. Even princes and kings if they overestimate themselves and cease to be standards will presumably fall.\n\nTherefore nobles find their roots among the commoners; the high is always founded upon the low. The reason why princes and kings speak of themselves as orphans, inferiors and unworthy, is because they recognize that their roots run down to the common life; is it not so?\n\nIf a carriage goes to pieces it is no longer a carriage, its unity is gone. A true self-hood does not desire to be overvalued as a gem, nor to be undervalued as a mere stone."},{chapter:40,content:"Retirement is characteristic of Tao just as weakness appears to be a characteristic of its activity.\n\nHeaven and earth and everything are produced from existence, but existence comes from nonexistence. . . ."},{chapter:41,content:"The superior scholar when he considers Tao earnestly practices it; an average scholar listening to Tao sometimes follows it and sometimes loses it; an inferior scholar listening to Tao ridicules it. Were it not thus ridiculed it could not be regarded as Tao.\n\nTherefore the writer says: Those who are most illumined by Tao are the most obscure. Those advanced in Tao are most retiring. Those best guided by Tao are the least prepossessing.\n\nThe high in virtue (teh) resemble a lowly valley; the whitest are most likely to be put to shame; the broadest in virtue resemble the inefficient. The most firmly established in virtue resemble the remiss. The simplest chastity resembles the fickle, the greatest square has no corner, the largest vessel is never filled. The greatest sound is void of speech, the greatest form has no shape. Tao is obscure and without name, and yet it is precisely this Tao that alone can give and complete."},{chapter:42,content:"Tao produces unity; unity produces duality; duality produces trinity; trinity produces all things. All things bear the negative principle (yin) and embrace the positive principle (yang). Immaterial vitality, the third principle (chi), makes them harmonious.\n\nThose things which are detested by the common people, namely to be called orphans, inferiors, and unworthies, are the very things kings and lords take for titles. There are some things which it is a gain to lose, and a loss to gain.\n\nI am teaching the same things which are taught by others. But the strong and aggressive: ones do not obtain a natural death (i.e., self-confident teachers do not succeed). I alone expound the basis of the doctrine of the Tao."},{chapter:43,content:"The most tender things of creation race over the hardest.\n\nA non-material existence enters into the most impenetrable.\n\nI therefore recognize an advantage in the doctrine of not doing (wu wei) and not speaking. But there are few in the world who obtain the advantage of non-assertion (wu wei) and silence."},{chapter:44,content:"Which is nearer, a name or a person? Which is more, personality or treasure? Is it more painful to gain or to suffer loss?\n\nExtreme indulgence certainly greatly wastes. Much hoarding certainly invites severe loss.\n\nA contented person is not despised. One who knows when to stop is not endangered; he will be able therefore to continue."},{chapter:45,content:"Extreme perfection seems imperfect, its function is not exhausted. Extreme fullness appears empty, its function is not exercised.\n\nExtreme straightness appears crooked; great skill, clumsy; great eloquence, stammering. Motion conquers cold, quietude conquers heat. Not greatness but purity and clearness are the world's standard."},{chapter:46,content:"When the world yields to Tao, race horses will be used to haul manure. When the world ignores Tao war horses are pastured on the public common.\n\nThere is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness.\n\nTherefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content."},{chapter:47,content:"Not going out of the door I have knowledge of the world. Not peeping through the window I perceive heaven's Tao. The more one wanders to a distance the less he knows.\n\nTherefore the wise man does not wander about but he understands, he does not see things but he defines them, he does not labor yet he completes."},{chapter:48,content:"He who attends daily to learning increases in learning. He who practices Tao daily diminishes. Again and again he humbles himself. Thus he attains to non-doing (wu wei). He practices non-doing and yet there is nothing left undone.\n\nTo command the empire one must not employ craft. If one uses craft he is not fit to command the empire."},{chapter:49,content:"The wise man has no fixed heart; in the hearts of the people he finds his own. The good he treats with goodness; the not-good he also treats with goodness, for teh is goodness. The faithful ones he treats with good faith; the unfaithful he also treats with good faith, for teh is good faith.\n\nThe wise man lives in the world but he lives cautiously, dealing with the world cautiously. He universalizes his heart; the people give him their eyes and ears, but he treats them as his children."},{chapter:50,content:"Life is a going forth; death is a returning home. Of ten, three are seeking life, three are seeking death, and three are dying. What is the reason? Because they live in life's experience. (Only one is immortal.)\n\nI hear it said that the sage when he travels is never attacked by rhinoceros or tiger, and when coming among soldiers does not fear their weapons. The rhinoceros would find no place to horn him, nor the tiger a place for his claws, nor could soldiers wound him. What is the reason? Because he is invulnerable."},{chapter:51,content:"Tao gives life to all creatures; teh feeds them; materiality shapes them; energy completes them. Therefore among all things there is none that does not honor Tao and esteem teh. Honor for Tao and esteem for teh is never compelled, it is always spontaneous. Therefore Tao gives life to them, but teh nurses them, raises them, nurtures, completes, matures, rears, protects them.\n\nTao gives life to them but makes no claim of ownership; teh forms them but makes no claim upon them, raises them but does not rule them. This is profound vitality (teh)."},{chapter:52,content:"When creation began, Tao became the world's mother. When one knows one's mother he will m turn know that he is her son. When he recognizes his sonship, he will in turn keep to his mother and to the end of life will be free from danger.\n\nHe who closes his mouth and shuts his sense gates will be free from trouble to the end of life. He who opens his mouth and meddles with affairs cannot be free from trouble even to the end of life.\n\nTo recognize one's insignificance is called enlightenment. To keep one's sympathy is called strength. He who uses Tao's light returns to Tao's enlightenment and does not surrender his person to perdition. This is called practicing the eternal."},{chapter:53,content:"Even if one has but a little knowledge he can walk in the ways of the great Tao; it is only self-assertion that one need fear.\n\nThe great Tao (Way) is very plain, but people prefer the bypaths. When the palace is very splendid, the fields are likely to be very weedy, and the granaries empty. To wear ornaments and gay colors, to carry sharp swords, to be excessive in eating and drinking, and to have wealth and treasure in abundance is to know the pride of robbers. This is contrary to Tao."},{chapter:54,content:"The thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted. The thing that is well guarded is not easily taken away. If one has sons and grandsons, the offering of ancestral worship will not soon cease.\n\nHe who practices Tao in his person shows that his teh is real. The family that practices it shows that their teh is abounding. The township that practices it shows that their teh is enduring. The state that practices it shows that their teh is prolific. The empire that practices it reveals that teh is universal. Thereby one person becomes a test of other persons, one family of other families, one town of other towns, one county of other counties, and one empire of all empires.\n\nHow do I know that this test is universal? By this same Tao."},{chapter:55,content:"The essence of teh is comparable to the state of a young boy. Poisonous insects will not sting him, wild beasts will not seize him, birds of prey will not attack him. The bones are weak, the muscles are tender, it is true, but his grasp is firm.\n\nHe does not yet know the relation of the sexes, but he has perfect organs, nevertheless. His spirit is virile, indeed! He can sob and cry all day without becoming hoarse, his harmony (as a child) is perfect indeed!\n\nTo recognize this harmony (for growth) is to know the eternal'. To recognize the eternal is to know enlightenment. To increase life (to cause things to grow) is to know blessedness. To be conscious of an inner fecundity is strength. Things fully grown are about to decay, they are the opposite of Tao. The opposite of Tao soon ceases."},{chapter:56,content:"The one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know. The wise man shuts his mouth and closes his gates. He softens his sharpness, unravels his tangles, dims his brilliancy, and reckons himself with the mysterious.\n\nHe is inaccessible to favor or hate; he cannot be reached by profit or injury; he cannot be honored or humiliated. Thereby he is honored by all."},{chapter:57,content:"The empire is administered with righteousness; the army is directed by craft; the people are captivated by non-diplomacy. How do I know it is so? By this same Tao.\n\nAmong people the more restrictions and prohibitions there are, the poorer they become. The more people have weapons, the more the state is in confusion. The more people are artful and cunning the more abnormal things occur. The more laws and orders are issued the more thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTherefore the wise man says: If a ruler practices wu wei the people will reform of themselves. If I love quietude the people will of themselves become righteous. If I avoid profit-making the people will of themselves become prosperous. If I limit my desires the people will of themselves become simple."},{chapter:58,content:"When an administration is unostentatious the people are simple. When an administration is inquisitive, the people are needy. Misery, alas, supports happiness. Happiness, alas, conceals misery. Who knows its limits? It never ceases. The normal becomes the abnormal. The good in turn becomes unlucky. The people's confusion is felt daily for a long time.\n\nTherefore the wise man is square, yet does not injure, he is angular but does not annoy. He is upright but is not cross. He is bright but not glaring."},{chapter:59,content:"In governing the people and in worshipping heaven nothing surpasses moderation. To value moderation, one must form the habit early. Its early acquisition will result in storing and accumulating vitality. By storing and accumulating vitality nothing is impossible.\n\nIf nothing is impossible then one is ignorant of his limits. If one does not know his limitations, one may possess the state. He who possesses moderation is thereby lasting and enduring. It is like having deep roots and a strong stem. This is of long life and enduring insight the Tao (way)."},{chapter:60,content:"One should govern a great state as one fries small fish (i.e., do not scale or clean them).\n\nWith Tao one may successfully rule the Empire. Ghosts will not frighten, gods will not harm, neither will wise men mislead the people. Since nothing frightens or harms the people, teh will abide."},{chapter:61,content:"A great state that is useful is like a bond of unity within the Empire; it is the Empire's wife.\n\nThe female controls the male by her quietude and submission. Thus a great state by its service to smaller states wins their allegiance. A small state by submission to a great state wins an influence over them. Thus some stoop to conquer, and others stoop and conquer.\n\nGreat states can have no higher purpose than to federate states and feed the people. Small states can have no higher purpose than to enter a federation and serve the people. Both alike, each in his own way, gain their end, but to do so, the greater must practice humility."},{chapter:62,content:"The Tao is the asylum of all things; the good man's treasure, the bad man's last resort. With beautiful words one may sell goods but in winning people one can accomplish more by kindness. Why should a man be thrown away for his evil? To conserve him was the Emperor appointed and the three ministers.\n\nBetter than being in the presence of the Emperor and riding with four horses, is sitting and explaining this Tao.\n\nThe reason the Ancients esteemed Tao was because if sought it was obtained, and because by it he that hath sin could be saved. Is it not so? Therefore the world honors Tao."},{chapter:63,content:"One should avoid assertion (wu wei) and practice inaction. One should learn to find taste in the tasteless, to enlarge the small things, and multiply the few. He should respond to hatred with kindness. He should resolve a difficulty while it is easy, and manage a great thing while it is small. Surely all the world's difficulties arose from slight causes, and all the world's great affairs had small beginnings.\n\nTherefore the wise man avoids to the end participation in great affairs and by so doing establishes his greatness.\n\nRash promises are lacking in faith and many things that appear easy are full of difficulties. Therefore the wise man considers every thing difficult and so to the end he has no difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"That which is at rest is easily restrained, that which has not yet appeared is easily prevented. The weak is easily broken, the scanty is easily scattered. Consider a difficulty before it arises, and administer affairs before they become disorganized. A tree that it takes both arms to encircle grew from a tiny rootlet. A pagoda of nine stories was erected by placing small bricks. A journey of three thousand miles begins with one step. If one tries to improve a thing, he mars it; if he seizes it, he loses it. The wise man, therefore, not attempting to form things does not mar them, and not grasping after things he does not lose them. The people in their rush for business are ever approaching success but continually failing. One must be as careful to the end as at the beginning if he is to succeed.\n\nTherefore the wise man desires to be free from desire, he does not value the things that are difficult of attainment. He learns to be unlearned, he returns to that which all others ignore. In that spirit he helps all things toward their natural development, but dares not interfere."},{chapter:65,content:"In the olden days those who obeyed the spirit of Tao did not enlighten the people but kept them simple hearted.\n\nThe reason people are difficult to govern is because of their smartness; likewise to govern a people with guile is a curse; and to govern them with simplicity is a blessing. He who remembers these two things is a model ruler. Always to follow this standard and rule is teh, the profound.\n\nProfound teh is deep indeed and far reaching. The very opposite of common things, but by it one obtains obedient subjects."},{chapter:66,content:"The reason rivers and seas are called the kings of the valley is because they keep below them.\n\nTherefore the wise man desiring to be above his people must in his demeanor keep below them; wishing to benefit his people, he must ever keep himself out of sight.\n\nThe wise man dwells above, yet the people do not feel the burden; he is the leader and the people suffer no harm. Therefore the world rejoices to exalt him and never wearies of him.\n\nBecause he will not quarrel with anyone, no one can quarrel with him."},{chapter:67,content:"All the world calls Tao great, yet it is by nature immaterial. It is because a thing is seemingly unreal that it is great. If a man affects to be great, how long can he conceal his mediocrity?\n\nTao has three treasures which he guards and cherishes. The first is called compassion; the second is called economy; the third is called humility. A man that is compassionate can 'be truly brave; if a man is economical he can be generous; if he is humble he can become a useful servant.\n\nIf one discards compassion and is still brave, abandons economy and is still generous, forsakes humility and still seeks to be serviceable, his days are numbered. On the contrary if one is truly compassionate, in battle he will be a conqueror and in defence he will be secure. When even Heaven helps people it is because of compassion that she does so."},{chapter:68,content:"He who excels as a soldier is the one who is not warlike; he who fights the best fight is not wrathful; he who best conquers an enemy is not quarrelsome; he who best employs people is obedient himself.\n\nThis is the virtue of not-quarreling, this is the secret of bringing out other men's ability, this is complying with Heaven. Since of old it is considered the greatest virtue (teh)."},{chapter:69,content:"A military expert has said: I do not dare put myself forward as a host, but always act as a guest. I hesitate to advance an inch, but am willing to withdraw a foot.\n\nThis is advancing by not advancing, it is winning without arms, it is charging without hostility, it is seizing without weapons. There is no mistake greater than making light of an enemy. By making light of an enemy we lose our treasure.\n\nTherefore when well-matched armies come to conflict, the one who is conscious of his weakness conquers."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet in all the world no one appears to understand them or to practice them.\n\nWords have an ancestor (a preceding idea), deeds have a master (a preceding purpose), and just as these are often not understood, so I am not understood.\n\nThey who understand me are very few, and on that account I am worthy of honor. The wise man wears wool (rather than silk) and keeps his gems out of sight."},{chapter:71,content:"To recognize one's ignorance of unknowable things is mental health, and to be ignorant of knowable things is sickness. Only by grieving over ignorance of knowable things are we in mental health. The wise man is wise because he understands his ignorance and is grieved over it."},{chapter:72,content:"When people are too ignorant to fear the fearsome thing, then it will surely come. Do not make the place where they dwell confining, the life they live wearisome. If they are let alone, they will not become restless. Therefore the wise man while not understanding himself regards himself, while cherishing he does not overvalue himself. Therefore he discards flattery and prefers regard."},{chapter:73,content:"Courage carried to daring leads to death. Courage restrained by caution leads to life. These two things, courage and caution, are sometimes beneficial and sometimes harmful. Some things are rejected by heaven, who can tell the reason? Therefore the wise man deems all acting difficult.\n\nThe Tao of heaven does not quarrel, yet it conquers. It speaks not, yet its response is good. It issues no summons but things come to it naturally because its devices are good. Heaven's net is vast, indeed! its meshes are wide but it loses nothing."},{chapter:74,content:"If the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death? If we teach people to fear death, then when one rebels he can be seized and executed; after that who will dare to rebel?\n\nThere is always an officer to execute a murderer, but if one takes the place of the executioner, it is like taking the place of a skilled carpenter at his hewing. If one takes the place of the skilled carpenter he is liable to cut himself. (Therefore do not interfere with Tao.)"},{chapter:75,content:"Starvation of a people comes when an official appropriates to himself too much of the taxes. The reason a people are difficult to govern is because the officials are too meddlesome; the people make light of death because they are so absorbed in life's interests. The one who is not absorbed in life is more moral than he who esteems life."},{chapter:76,content:"When a man is living he is tender and fragile. When he dies he is hard and stiff. It is the same with everything, the grass and trees, in life, are tender and delicate, but when they die they become rigid and dry.\n\nTherefore those who are hard and stiff belong to death's domain, while the tender and weak belong to the realm of life.\n\nTherefore soldiers are most invincible when they will not conquer. When a tree is grown to its greatest strength it is doomed. The strong and the great stay below; the tender and weak rise above."},{chapter:77,content:"Tao of heaven resembles the stretching of a bow. The mighty it humbles, the lowly it exalts. They who have abundance it diminishes and gives to them who have need.\n\nThat is Tao of heaven; it depletes those who abound, and completes those who lack.\n\nThe human way is not so. Men take from those who lack to give to those who already abound. Where is the man who by his abundance can best serve the world?\n\nThe wise man makes but claims not, he accomplishes merit, yet is not attached to it, neither does he display his excellence. Is it not so?"},{chapter:78,content:"In the world nothing is more fragile than water, and yet of all the agencies that attack hard substances nothing can surpass it.\n\nOf all things there is nothing that can take the place of Tao. By it the weak are conquerors of the strong, the pliable are conquerors of the rigid. In the world every one knows this, but none practice it.\n\nTherefore the wise man declares: he who is guilty of the country's sin may be the priest at the altar. He who is to blame for the country's misfortunes, is often the Empire's Sovereign. True words are often paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When reconciling great hatred there will some remain. How can it be made good?\n\nTherefore the wise man accepts the debit side of the account and does not have to enforce payment from others. They who have virtue (teh) keep their obligations, they who have no virtue insist on their rights. Tao of heaven has no favorites but always helps the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"In a small country with few people let there be officers over tens and hundreds but not to exercise power. Let the people be not afraid of death, nor desire to move to a distance. Then though there be ships and carriages, they will have no occasion to use them. Though there be armor and weapons there will be no occasion for donning them. The people can return to knotted cords for their records, they can delight in their food, be proud of their clothes, be content with their dwellings, rejoice in their customs.\n\nOther states may be close neighbors, their cocks and dogs may be mutually heard, people will come to old age and die but will have no desire to go or come."},{chapter:81,content:"Faithful words are often not pleasant; pleasant words are often not faithful. Good men do not dispute; the ones who dispute are not good. The learned men are often not the wise men, nor the wise men, the learned. The wise man does not hoard, but ever working for others, he will the more exceedingly acquire. Having given to others freely, he himself will have in plenty. Tao of heaven benefits but does not injure. The wise man's Tao leads him to act but not to quarrel."}]},{name:"John Chalmers",component:[{chapter:1,content:"The tau (reason) which can be tau - ed (reasoned) is not the Eternal Tau (Reason).

And thus, in like manner, existence and non-existence mutually originate (or suggest) each other; so also difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, treble and bass, before and after. The sage accordingly confines himself to what is without effort (not demonstrative). He carries on teaching without words ' and everything works without hindrance. He produces without holding possession. He acts without presuming on the result. He completes his work and assumes no position for himself. And, since he assumes no position, he never loses any."},{chapter:3,content:"Not exalting worth keeps the people from rivalry. Not prizing things hard to procure keeps the people from theft.

That by which heaven and earth are long and lasting, is their not aiming at life. This is the reason why they live long.

Therefore the world delights to exalt him, and no one is offended.\nBecause he strives not, therefore none in the world can possibly strive with him.\n"},{chapter:67,content:"While all the world says I am great, I am, to all appearance, an incompetent creature.\nBut, indeed, if I am great, I appear, for this very reason, to be an incompetent creature. \nThose who come up to the (vulgar) standard have existed for a long time as small men.\nAs for me, I have three precious things which I hold fast and prize. The first is called compassion, the second is called economy, and the third is called not daring to take the precedence of the world (humility). Being compassionate, I can therefore be brave. Being Economical, I can therefore be liberal. Not daring to take the precedence of the world, I can therefore become the chief of all the perfect ones.\nBut in the present day men give up compassion and cultivate only courage. They give up economy and aim only at liberality. They give up the last place and only seek the first.\nIt is their death. Compassion is that which is victorious in the attack, and secure in the defence. When Heaven would save a man, it encircles him with compassion.\n"},{chapter:68,content:"The man who excels as a commander is not warlike. The man who excels as a fighter is not wrathful. The man who excels as a conqueror takes no part in war. The man who excels in employing others places himself below them. This I call the virtue of not striving. This I call the power of employing others. This I call being the associate of Heaven - the supreme aim of antiquity."},{chapter:69,content:"A certain person of military experience has said, \u201c I dare not be the host (to lead on the fight); I would rather be the guest. I dare not advance an inch (to make the first attack); I would rather retire a foot.\u201d Now this (principle if carried out) would, I say, result in there being no following of ranks, no baring of the arm, no charging of the enemy, no grasping of weapons.\nThere is no calamity greater than making light of the enemy. By making light of the enemy, we are almost sure to lose our treasure. Therefore, when opposing warriors join in battle, the pitiful is always the conqueror.\n"},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easily known, and very easily practised. (Yet) none in the world can know them, or can practise them. The words have an ancestry, and the things have a Head.\nBut because these are not understood, therefore I am not known. Few are they who know me.\nWorthy are they who copy me. For the sage wears a coarse garment, and hides his jewel in his bosom.\n"},{chapter:71,content:"The best part of knowledge is (conscious) ignorance. The disease of ignorance is (the conceit of) knowledge. If one only takes this disease for what it is, a disease, he will thereby be free from it. The sage has not this disease, because he takes it for what it is, and straight way he is free from it."},{chapter:72,content:"When people do not stand in awe of present dangers, they run into greater ones. They should beware of finding their house too narrow, and despising their condition of life. If they do not despise it, it will not despise them.\nThis is why the sage, while he knows himself, does not show himself off; and while he loves himself, does not rate himself high. He puts aside the one thing, that he may attend to the other.\n"},{chapter:73,content:"One man who has the courage to dare, will be slain; and another who has the courage to restrain himself (not to dare), will survive. Of these two, one seems to have the advantage and the other the damage. But who can tell why either of them should be the object of Heaven's hatred? This is why the sage holds it difficult (to act).\nThe Tau of Heaven does not strive, yet conquers well, \u2014does not speak, yet answers well,\u2014does not call, yet things come of their own accord, \u2014is slack, yet plans well. The net of heaven is very wide in its meshes, and yet misses nothing.\n"},{chapter:74,content:"When the people do not fear death, to what purpose is death still used (as a punishment) to overawe them? And should the people be kept in continual fear of death, and I lay hold of those who are not to be so intimidated and slay them,\u2014who would dare? There is always the Great Executioner. Now for any man to act the Executioner's part, I say, it is hewing out the Great Architect's work for him. And he who undertakes to hew for the Great Architect rarely fails to cut his hands."},{chapter:75,content:"The people suffer from famine by reason of exorbitant taxation. This is the cause of famine.\nThe people are difficult to govern, because their superiors make so much ado. This is the reason of the difficulty. The people make light of death, because they seek to live in wealth.\nThis is the reason of their making light of death.\nBut only he who takes no measures whatever for life is above all this selfishness is superior to him who highly esteems life).\n"},{chapter:76,content:"Man in his life is supple and tender, in his death he is rigid and strong. It is the same with everything. Grass and trees are, in their life, weak and tender, and, in their death, withered and tough. Therefore the rigid and the strong are the attendants of death; and the tender and weak the attendants of life. Hence the warrior, when strong, does not conquer.\nWhen a tree is strong, it becomes a mere support: the strong and big must stay below, while the tender and weak stay above.\n"},{chapter:77,content:"The Tau of Heaven may be compared to the extending of a bow. It brings down the high, and exalts the low. It takes from those who have over-much, and gives to those who have not enough. The Tau of Heaven takes away where there is too much, and makes up where there is deficiency. Not so the Tau of man. Man takes from those who have not enough, to serve those who have too much. Who is the man that, having an overplus, can serve the world with it? It is only he who has Tau.\nThis is the reason why the sage acts and expects nothing; completes his meritorious work and holds no place. He does not wish to show his worth.\n"},{chapter:78,content:"Of all the weak things in the world, nothing exceeds water; and yet of those who attack hard and strong things, I know not what is superior to it. Don't make light of this. The fact that the weak can conquer the strong, and the tender the hard, is known to all the world, yet none can carry it out in practice. Therefore the sage says, \u201c Hewho bears the reproach of his country shall be called the lord of the land. He who bears the calamities of his country shall be called the king of the world.\u201d\nThis is the language of strict truth, though it seems paradoxical.\n"},{chapter:79,content:"When terms are made after a great quarrel, there must be always a remaining grudge. To let matters rest will be found the best way. Therefore the sage takes care of his own part of the compact, and exacts nothing of others. The man of virtue attends only to his promises in the compact. The man without virtue attends only to his claims.\nThe Tau of Heaven has no favourites (relations). It always gives to the good man.\n"},{chapter:80,content:"(Suppose I had) a small kingdom with few people, and only some tens or hundreds of men available for service,I would not use them. I would make the people think death a grievous thing; and then they would not roam to a distance. Though they might have boats and carriages, they would not ride (away) in them. Though they might have armour, they would have no occasion to put it on. I would make the people return to the use of the quippas (knotted cords), \u2014 relish their food,\u2014think their clothes elegant, -rest happily in their homes, \u2014take pleasure in their own simple) habits. While neighbouring nations might be within sight, and cocks crowing and dogs barking might be within hearing one of another, yet the people would grow old and die, without going and coming together."},{chapter:81,content:"Faithful words are not fine. Fine words are not faithful. The good do not debate. The debater is not good. The knowing are not learned. The learned are not knowing.\nThe sage does not lay up treasures. The Own. more he does for others, the more he has of his The more he gives to others, the more he is increased.\nThis is the Tau of Heaven, which benefits and does not injure.\nThis is the Tau of the sage, who acts but does not strive.\n"}]},{name:"Frederic Balfour",component:[{chapter:1,content:"The TAO, or Principle of Nature, may be discussed [by all]; it is not the popular or common Tao\u2014[e.g., the tao-li of ethics, dealing with the ### and the ###].\nIts Name may be named [i.e., the TAO may receive a designation, though of itself it has none]; but it is not an ordinary name, [or name in the usual sense of the word, for it is a presentment or \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd of the Infinite].\nIts nameless period was that which preceded the birth of the Universe, [the ###];\nIn being spoken of by name, it is as the Progenitrix of All Things, [the period of the ###, which divided and produced the ###].\nIt is therefore in habitual passionlessness [the ### or Quiescent phase of TAO] that its mystery may be scanned; and in habitual desire [the ### or Active phase of TAO] that its developments may be perceived.\nThese two conditions, the Active and the Quiescent, alike proceed [from TAO]; it is only in name that they differ. Both may be called profundities; and the depth of profundity is the gate of every mystery."},{chapter:2,content:"The Beautiful being once recognised as such by the world, the Repulsive appears [as its converse]. Goodness being once recognised as such, Evil appears in like manner. Thus existence and non-existence produce each other; the difficult and the easy bring about each other; the long and the short impart form to each other; the high and low comply [or change places] with each other; sounds and voices harmonise with each other; priority and sequence alternate with each other.\nWherefore the Sage pursues a policy of inaction, and teaches men in silence; [i.e., he conforms to the TAO or Course of Nature, which proceeds silently and spontaneously, and thus the people learn to govern themselves by his example without needing the interferences of legislation and instruction].\nHe forms all things without shrinking [from the labour]; produces them without claiming the possession [of virtue]; acts without presuming on [his ability]; and completes his achievements without taking any credit to himself. It is only he who thus does not stand upon his merit; and therefore his merit does not depart from him."},{chapter:3,content:"[The Sage], by not showing exclusive approval of those who are eminent in virtue, prevents the people from quarrelling; by not setting high store on things difficult to obtain, he prevents the people from becoming robbers; by closing his eyes to objects of desire, he secures his heart from corruption. Wherefore the Sage, in governing, does so with a heart empty [of all distractions and temptations], but a bosom full [of justice and benevolence]; he makes his will pliant, his bodily frame-work firm; he ever keeps the people from [harmful] knowledge and desires, and prevents those who have such knowledge from daring to put it into practice. He pursues a policy of inaction, and there is therefore nothing that is left ungoverned."},{chapter:4,content:"The TAO is full [q.d., exhaustless and complete]; yet in operation as though not self-elated. In its origin it is as it were the Ancestor of All Things. It chastens asperity; it unravels confusion; it moderates the radiance [proceeding from those in whom TAO is embodied\u2014see Chuang Tsze, 'K\xeang-sang Ch\u2018u']; and it identifies itself with the sordid ones of the earth [the \"dust\" or common people\u2014see Mencius, Book V; q.d., it enables a man to associate with the base without being defiled]. Pellucid [as a spreading ocean] it yet has the semblance of permanence. I know not whose offspring it is. Its \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd existed before God was."},{chapter:5,content:"If Heaven and Earth were not benevolent, they would regard creation in the light of grass [which is worthless] and dogs [which are killed]. If the Sage were not benevolent, he would likewise regard the people in the light of grass and dogs.\nThe space between Heaven and Earth may be compared to a leathern bag, or box; [a receptacle with Heaven for a lid and Earth for a floor]. It is a vacuum [outside which there is nothing], exercising no pressure [on that which is within]; the more it moves, the more prolific it is. Those who talk too much will often come to an end of their words. It is better to maintain rectitude [inwardly]."},{chapter:6,content:"The Spirit of the Depths is immortal; it is called the Azure [Heaven] and the Mother [Earth]. The passage through which these Two Influences [###] emerge and enter is called the root [or nidus] of the visible creation. They are ceaseless in action as though permanent, and may be drawn upon [used, or laid under contribution] without ever being exhausted.\n"},{chapter:7,content:"Heaven is everlasting; Earth endures. The reason of the endurance of Heaven and Earth is that they were not self-produced. Therefore it is that they are able to endure for ever. Thus, though the Sage [in imitation of them] regards the cultivation of his body as of secondary importance, his body still progresses [of its own accord]; he discards his body, and yet his body is preserved. Is not this because he has no selfishness? Wherefore he is able to realise all his wishes [in carrying out the principles of TAO in his own person]."},{chapter:8,content:"The goodness of the Ruler resembles water [in pliancy, adaptability, and fertilising power]. The goodness of water is beneficial to all things, and that without struggling.\nThe abiding-place [of the Imperial goodness] is despised by the multitude [for it is lowly\u2014referring to the downward course of water]; and therefore it is near to TAO. Wherever it dwells, it sanctifies the spot. In the heart, its sanctifying properties are unfathomable. In bestowing, it sanctifies benevolence; in speaking, it sanctifies trustworthiness; in administration, it sanctifies government; in the fulfilment of daily work, it sanctifies ability; in the adoption of public measures it sanctifies acting seasonably. It alone never strives against [or places itself in opposition to] anyone; and therefore it gives rise to no resentful feelings."},{chapter:9,content:"It is better to desist altogether, than, having once grasped [the TAO], to pride oneself on one's self-sufficiency. Research, if carried on to too keen a point, prevents the preservation of the body [q.d., hastens death]. When a hall is filled up with gold and jewels, it cannot be guarded intact. When wealth and honours are combined with arrogance, they themselves invoke calamity. To keep oneself in the background when merit has been achieved and fame has followed in its wake; this is the way of Heaven."},{chapter:10,content:"Having received, in the birth-process, a living soul, one is able, by preserving its individuality [pure and uncorrupted], to prevent disunion [with the pure original]. By controlling the vital force, and bringing it to the utmost degre'e of pliancy, one is able to become as a little child again\u2014[revert to one's pristine state of innocence]. By washing and cleansing oneself of that which Heaven alone can see [i.e., secret sins], one may become without one blemish. By governing the Empire by love towards the people, one is able to keep them from knowing [evil; they will live in an atmosphere of contentment and trust].\nWhen the Door of Heaven is now open, now closed, then the Female Principle will disappear; [all will be pure Yang].\nIf one's understanding reaches in every direction, he can disregard knowledge [as such; there will be no such thing, to him, as ignorance]. What he produces, he nourishes. Producing, he does not claim the possession [of virtue]; acting, he does not presume upon [his ability]. Though he be a veteran among his fellows, he assumes no seignory over them. This may be called Sublime Virtue\u2014[the highest development of TAO]."},{chapter:11,content:"Thirty spokes, uniting in a nave, were employed [in olden times] before the invention of carriages. Clay made into utensils was employed before the time of palaces and dwellings [when there were no sacrificial vases, goblets, or bowls]. A door and a window, hewn [in a hill-side], did duty for a residence before the erection of houses. Wherefore, the possession of these things may be regarded as beneficial, while their [former] absence may be said to have been useful [in that it led to the necessity of their being made]."},{chapter:12,content:"The five colours blind the eyes of men. The five tones deafen their ears. The five flavours vitiate their palates. Galloping and hunting induce derangement of the mind. Objects that are difficult of attainment lead them to incur obstacles, [or injury\u2014in their pursuit].\nThus the Sage cares for his inner self, and not for that which his eye can see; for which reason he discards the latter and preserves the former."},{chapter:13,content:"Favour and disgrace are alike a cause of fear. Honours bring great calamity upon the body.\nWhat is it that one calls favour and disgrace? Disgrace implies downfal; the loss of one and subjection to the other, are equally causes of apprehension. Therefore it may be said that favour and disgrace both give rise to fear.\nAnd what is meant by saying that honours bring calamity upon the body? The calamities which come upon me are the consequence of my possessing a body; had I none, what calamities could I incur?\nWherefore, if the honours which come upon me personally are on account of my position as a ruler, then the whole Empire will subject itself to me; and those who cultivate personal benevolence in ruling may commit themselves to the Empire for ever."},{chapter:14,content:"That which may be looked for, but proves invisible, is called the Distant. That which may be listened for, but proves inaudible, is called Vacancy. That which may be clutched at, but proves intangible, is called the Subtle. Words are inadequate thoroughly to examine these three properties; therefore they blend together and become One.\nAbove, it is not bright; below, it is not dim.

These, [the non-adepts], being unable to learn it, strove by main force, therefore, to act it out in practice. They endured [the hardships of their search] as those who ford streams in the winter. Cautious were they, as those who dread [the ridicule of] their neighbours; reverent were they, as those who entertain a visitor; expansive were they, as ice on the point of melting; simple and unpolished were they, as unhewn wood; vacant were they, as a ravine; undiscerning were they, as turbid water.\nWho is able to make turbid water grow gradually clear by reducing it to quiescence? Who is able to impart [unending] life to that which is at rest by setting it in perpetual motion?

All things, after flourishing like the herb y\xfcn, return each to what it sprang from. Returning to this source is called quiescence, and this implies a reversion to the original ordinance [of Heaven]. Reversion to the original ordinance [of Heaven] is called the basis or pivot [###] of TAO. Knowledge of this may be called enlightenment, while ignorance of it leads to a reckless working-out of one's own ruin. He who knows it, bears with others. Bearing with others, he is just; being just, he is fit to be a king; being a king, he is the associate of Heaven [whose decree he holds and whose ordinancee he carries out]. Heaven is [the offspring of] TAO; and TAO survives the death of him who is the embodiment of it, living on unharmed for ever."},{chapter:17,content:'Those of pre\xebminent wisdom and purity knew [this TAO] intuitively from their birth, and so possessed it. Those of the second rank\u2014the men of virtue\u2014approached it nearly, and eulogised it. Those of the third rank\u2014who were still above the commonalty\u2014stood in awe of it. Those of the lowest rank held it in light esteem. Their belief in it was superficial, or imperfect; while there were even some who did not believe in it at all.\n[The first] spoke only with forethought and calculation, as though honouring their words. When their [public] labours were achieved, and affairs progressed unimpeded, the people all said, ""This is our natural and spontaneous condition.""'},{chapter:18,content:"When the Great TAO [of the Five Rulers and the Three Dynasties] fell into disuse, Benevolence and Rectitude appeared.\nMen of wisdom and kindness came forth, and then hypocrisy began to spread\u2014[good men were counterfeited by the base]. Discord arose in families, and this manifested [by contrast] the virtues of filial piety and compassion. The State was thrown into anarchy, and this led to the appearance of faithful Ministers."},{chapter:19,content:"When Sages are rejected as rulers, and the services of the wise are discarded, the people's wealth will increase a hundredfold; [for their hearts will all be set on covetousness]. When benevolence and rectitude [in government] are abjured, [such will be the height of disorder that] the people will revert to their natural qualities of filial piety and compassion [by sheer force of reaction]. When ingenuities of luxury and eagerness for gain are renounced, there will be no more robbers\u2014[for there will be no accumulations of wealth to be worth stealing]. These three propositions show that mere externals are insufficient for good government, and therefore each man should be ordered to confine himself to performing his own special work in life."},{chapter:20,content:"By looking always on the reality of things, and preserving the simple truth, [the people] will become less selfish and have fewer desires; and by pursuing their researches [into the Doctrine] to the utmost limit, they may avoid sorrow.\nHow small is the distance dividing a prompt affirmative from a sycophantic acquiescence; [yet] how great is that between virtue and immorality! I cannot but fear that which is feared by others.[Their scholarship], how neglected is it! It is still night with them.\nThe world is joyful and merry as on a day of sacrifice, or as those who mount a belvedere in spring-time. I alone prefer solitude and quiet, and seek not to pry into futurity. I am like an infant ere it has grown to be a child; listlessly I roam hither and thither, as though I had no home to go to. The multitude have abundance and to spare; I alone am like one who has relinquished everything. Have I, therefore, the heart of a fool? Confused and dim, while the vulgar are [apparently] enlightened; I alone am in the dark. Tossed to and fro, like the sea; roving without cessation. The multitude have whereupon to employ their energies; I alone am doltish as a clown.[But] I alone differ from all others in that I reverence my Nursing Mother."},{chapter:21,content:"The appearance of Virtue in its fullest exuberance is no more than the result of compliance with the TAO. TAO, considered as an entity, is obscure and vague. Vague and obscure! yet within it there is Form. Obscure and vague! yet within it there is Substance. Vacuous and unfathomable! yet within it there is Quintessential Energy\u2014and this is supremely real. Within it, too, there is Trustworthiness; from ancient down to modern times its name has never been lost; by it I can include in the range of my observation the whole of animate nature. How am I cognisant of the acquiescence of animate nature [in TAO]?\u2014By TAO itself."},{chapter:22,content:'[In cultivating TAO] there are first the sprouts; then perfection. First, there is perversion; then rectification. First there is hollowness [receptivity]; then plenitude. First there is destruction [of the old]; then renovation. First there is humility; then acquisition. Self-sufficiency is followed by suspicion [on the part of others]. Therefore the Sage preserves unity [in his heart] and becomes a pattern to the whole world. He does not say himself that he can see, and therefore he is perspicacious. He does not say himself that he is right, and therefore he is manifested to all. He does pot praise himself, and therefore his merit is recognised. He is not self-conceited, and therefore he increases [in knowledge]. And as he never strives with anybody, so the world does not strive with him.\nCan that saying of the olden times\u2014""First the sprouts, then perfection""\u2014be called meaningless? The attainment of genuine perfection implies a reversion [to the original nature of man].'},{chapter:23,content:"Reticence in speech leads to spontaneity. A boisterous wind does not continue after dawn; a deluge of rain does not outlast the day. Who is it that produces these two phenomena?\u2014Heaven and Earth. Seeing, then, that the forces of nature cannot last for ever, how much less can man?\nWherefore among those who order their affairs in accordance with TAO, those who understand the doctrine are identified with TAO; those who are possessed of virtue are identified with the Virtue [or attributes\u2014of TAO]; while those who lose both are identified with their loss\u2014[so that they do not recognise it as being loss].\nThose who become thus identified with TAO are also received joyfully by those who already possess the TAO. Those who become identified with its Virtue are also received joyfully by those who already possess the Virtue. The loss sustained by those who are identified with the loss of both is also rejoiced in by those who are already in the same case.\nWhere there is insufficiency of faith on the part of one, there will result an entire absence of faith on the part of others."},{chapter:24,content:"A man who raises himself on tiptoe cannot remain firm. A man with crooked legs cannot walk [far].\nHe who says himself that he can see is not enlightened. He who says himself that he is right is not manifested to others. He who praises himself has no merit. He who is self-conceited will not increase [in knowledge].\nSuch men may be said to search after TAO that they may gorge themselves in feeding, and act the parasite; moreover, they are universally detested. Therefore those who are possessed of TAO do not act thus."},{chapter:25,content:"There was Something formed from chaos, which came into being before Heaven and Earth. Silent and boundless it stands alone, and never changes. It pervades every place, and incurs no danger [of being impaired]. It may be called the Mother of the Universe. I know not its name; but its designation is TAO. If forced to call it something, I will call it great. Being great, it moves ever onward; and thus I say that it is remote. Being remote, I say that it returns.\nTherefore TAO is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the King also is great. In the Universe there are four things that are great, and the King is one of them. Man regulates himself by the Earth; Earth regulates itself by Heaven; Heaven regulates itseIf by TAO; and TAO regulates itseIf by its own inherent nature\u2014or, spontaneously."},{chapter:26,content:"The weighty is the source of the light; stillness dominates disquietude. Wherefore, while the Sage proceeds the whole day [according to TAO], he never departs from either calmness or gravity. Although there may be spectacles of worldly glory [to attract him] he sits quietly alone, far above the common crowd. How is that a Prince of Ten Thousand Studs of Horses can regard his own person as of less importance than his regal dignity?\nThis lightness [on the part of the Prince] loses him his Ministers, while restlessness [on the part of the Ministers] loses them their Prince."},{chapter:27,content:"The conduct of the virtuous leaves neither trace nor clue. The words of the virtuous afford no ground for fault-finding. The projects of the virtuous require no intrigue.\nWhen the virtuous are obstructed [in their policy], though there be no bolt to the door which shuts them in, it yet cannot be opened. When the virtuous enter into relations with others, though they be not bound by the ties of contract, they yet may not release themselves [from their obligations].\nThus the Sage ever uses his goodness in saving others; and therefore there are none who are abandoned. He ever uses his goodness in saving the inanimate creation; and therefore there are none of these who are abandoned. This is called being doubly enlightened.\nWherefore the virtuous man is the teacher, or patron, of the bad man, while the bad man is employed as material, on which to work, by the virtuous man. If the bad man does not reverence the other as his teacher, nor the good man love the former as his material; then, in spite of any wisdom either may possess, they are both greatly blinded. This doctrine is both important and sublime."},{chapter:28,content:"He who, conscious of manly strength, guards a womanly weakness, becomes the channel of the whole Empire [to which all minor streams converge]. Being thus the channel of the whole Empire, the cardinal virtues [###] will never depart from him, and he will revert to a condition of childlike innocence.\nHe who, conscious of light, keeps in obscurity, will become a model for the whole Empire. Being a model for the whole Empire, the cardinal virtues will never fail him, and he will revert to the Unconditioned.\nHe who, conscious of his glory, guards humility, will become the valley of the whole Empire. Being the valley of the Empire, he will revert to his original simplicity. When this simplicity is distributed, q.d., brought into play, the man becomes a thing of utility [to the State].\nThe Sage employs men of this simplicity, and advances them to high rank; therefore his administration is on a grand scale, and never comes to an end."},{chapter:29,content:"When a man desires to obtain the Empire, and govern it [by acting on this principle of simplicity], I see that he does so in spite of himself. The insignia of royalty may not be used by such.\nThose who make them will break them; those who clutch at them will lose them. For among the things of the world there are those who lead and those who follow; there are ejaculations of grief and ejaculations of gladness; there are those who are strong and those who are weak; there are those who sustain loads and those who are good for nothing. For this reason the Sage puts away excess, display, and pride."},{chapter:30,content:"Those who use TAO in assisting their Sovereign do not employ soldiers to force the Empire. The methods of government they adopt are such as have a tendency to react upon themselves. Where garrisons are quartered, briars and thorns spring up\u2014q.d., the land is deserted by the people. Disastrous years inevitably follow in the wake of great armies.\nWise rulers act with decision, and nothing more. They do not venture to use overbearing measures. They are decided without self-conceit, or boasting, or pride. They are decided in spite of themselves, and without presuming on brute force.\nAfter a man has arrived at the prime of his strength, he begins to age. This is attributable to his not possessing TAO. Those who do not possess TAO die before their time."},{chapter:31,content:"The finest weapons of war are implements of disaster. All creatures hate them; therefore those who are possessed of TAO make no use of them.\nThe ideal man, in his own house, regards the left hand as the more honourable. Those who use weapons of war, give honour to the right\u2014[as being that in which arms are brandished]. Weapons are implements of disaster; they are not the implements employed by the ideal man. If he ever uses them, he does so because he cannot help it. He regards tranquillity and passionlessness as supreme.\nVictory in war is not a beautiful thing. Those who see beauty in it are such as take delight in killing men. It is impossible for those who take delight in killing others to obtain the suffrages of the Empire.\nIn matters of joyful import, the left-hand is the more highly esteemed; in matters of disaster, the right-hand. The general second in command occupies the left-hand position [in the war-chariot]; it is the general-in-chief who is stationed on the right. The meaning of this is that the latter is placed similarly to a chief mourner at a funeral\u2014q.d., in an inauspicious position. Having been instrumental in killing multitudes of people, he should weep bitterly with pity and compassion. Having gained a victory in battle, he thus still occupies the position of [chief] mourner at a funeral."},{chapter:32,content:"TAO remains ever nameless. However insignificant may be the simplicity [of those who cultivate it] the Empire does not presume to claim their services [as Ministers].\nIf Princes and Monarchs could but preserve this simplicity, every creature in the world would submit itself to them; Heaven and Earth would be in mutual accord, and shower down sweet dew; the people would need no laws, but live in harmony of themselves.\nIt was in the beginning that a name was fabricated [for TAO]. This name once existing, Heaven, also, may be known; and such knowledge ensures the indestructibility [of the doctrine].\nThe presence of TAO in the world may be compared to streams [which ever flow], and mountain-gorges [which are indestructible], in their union with rivers and seas [which are unfathomable]."},{chapter:33,content:"They who know others are shrewd; self-knowers are enlightened. Those who overcome others have bodily strength; self-vanquishers have determination. Those who know when they have enough are rich. Those who act with determination or perseverance have strength of will. Those who lose not what they have learnt\u2014the TAO\u2014retain it always. Those who, up till death, are not lost [to TAO], enjoy posthumous activity."},{chapter:34,content:"The Great TAO is all-pervasive; it may be seen on the right and on the left.\nAll things depend upon it, and are produced; it denies itself to none.\nIt achieves its works of merit, but has no name or reputation [among men]. With tenderness it nourishes all things, yet claims no lordship over them.\nIt is ever passionless, and may be named among the smallest things\nAll things submit to it, yet it claims no lordship over them; it may be called great.\nThus the Sage to the end of his life never exalts himself; and thus he is able to achieve great things."},{chapter:35,content:"If the Great Simulachrum\u2014q.d., the image or 'idea' of TAO\u2014be obtained, the Empire will be for ever free from harm. There will be tranquillity, peace, and universal joy, [the attraction of which], acting as a bait, will detain the passing traveller.\nThe utterance of TAO is insipid; it has no flavour. If looked at, it appears not worth seeing; if listened to, it appears not worth hearing; but if used, it is found inexhaustible in resources."},{chapter:36,content:"When one feels a desire to concentrate it [in one's own heart], it is imperatively necessary to display it openly.\nWhen one feels a desire to cultivate it in its pliant phase, it is imperatively necessary to fortify and strengthen [one's own powers].\nWhen one feels a desire to abandon or neglect it, it is imperatively necessary to stir up one's mind afresh [in its pursuit].\nIf anyone feels a desire to obtain it, it is imperatively necessary that it should be imparted to him.\nBy this means, the hidden phases [of TAO] will become clear. The weak and pliable overcomes the strong and hard.\nA fish cannot leave the depths. The treasures of a State should not be employed to influence the people."},{chapter:37,content:"TAO is ever inactive; yet there is nothing it does not do.\nIf feudal Princes and Sovereigns can but preserve it, all creatures will reform themselves. But if, once reformed, desires should again arise, I would restrain them by the exercise of the Simplicity which is without a name. This nameless Simplicity will prevent the rise of desires; an absence of desire will produce quiescence; and then the Empire will become settled of its own accord."},{chapter:38,content:"Virtue, in those of supreme authority, does not itself claim to be virtue; and that is why [virtuous rulers] are possessed of [true] virtue.\nVirtue, in those of lower rank, does not recognise its own loss as such; and that is why unvirtuous [Ministers and people] have no [true] virtue.\nThe virtue of those in supreme authority is inactive, and does not use action [in government].\nThe virtue of those of lower rank is active, and employs active measures.\n[Although] the benevolence of those in supreme authority is active, it yet does not depend on action [for making itself felt].\nThe rectitude of those in supreme authority is active, and finds vent in active measures.\nThe ceremonial observances of those in supreme authority are active, and there is not a single man who does not respond to them. Under these circumstances all will bare the arm and submit to the guidance [of their rulers].\nTherefore, when the TAO has attained its full development, it results in Virtue; when Virtue has attained its full development, it results in Benevolence; when Benevolence has attained its full development, it results in Rectitude; when Rectitude has attained its full development, it results in Ceremonial observances.\nWhen ceremonial observances are nothing but an attenuation of uprightness and sincerity, they become the head and front of disorder.\nThose who are in advance of others in knowledge constitute the outward glory of TAO; and, from such, comes the beginning of folly\u2014[because those who succeed them are dazzled by the display and take no account of the reality within].\nThus it is that great men take their stand on what is solid, and not on what is flimsy; on what is true, and not on what is showy. For this reason they discard the one and adopt the other."},{chapter:39,content:"The things which of old obtained the Unity are,\u2014\nHeaven, which by it [the pure yang] became clear.\nEarth, which by it [the pure yin] became motionless.\nThe gods, which by it became divinely intelligent.\nThe valleys, which by it became full.\nAll creatures, which by it are produced.\nPrinces and Kings, which by it rule uprightly.\nTo carry out this doctrine to the proof:\u2014Heaven, if deprived of its source of clearness, would be in danger of disruption; Earth, if deprived of its source of motionlessness, would be in danger of upsetting; the gods, if deprived of their source of divine intelligence, would be in danger of being abandoned by their worshippers; valleys, if deprived of their source of replenishment, would be in danger of drying up; creatures, if deprived of their source of production, or life, would be in danger of annihilation; and Princes and Kings, if deprived of their source of honour and dignity, would be in danger of being overthrown.\nTherefore, the ruling classes regard the commonalty as the foundation [of their power] and those in high position necessarily regard the proletariat as that upon which they rest. Hence Princes and Kings style themselves orphans, solitary ones, unworthy ones; is not this an acknowledgment that the commonalty is their support, or point d'appui? Is it not so? To come, then, to the point: when patricians and plebeians are both without [conflicting] private desires, the only difference between the two is that the former resemble polished gems, while the latter are like unhewn stones."},{chapter:40,content:"Resistance is the motion of TAO\u2014[or, Motion implies a withstanding of TAO, the essence of which is repose]. Pliancy is TAO put into practice.\nAll things in the world owe their life to its [TAO'S] existence, and this existence sprang from non-existence [the ### from the ###]."},{chapter:41,content:"When scholars of the first grade hear of TAO, they sedulously practise it.\nWhen second-rate scholars hear of it, they now observe, now lose it.\nWhen scholars of the lowest sort hear of it, they greatly deride it. If it did not provoke derision [on the part of such], it would not be worth the name of TAO.\nWherefore, as the ancient apophthegms express it,\u2014\nThose who are illuminated quoad TAO are as though in darkness\u2014[for its depths are unfathomable].\nThose who enter TAO are as though they receded [from caution and hesitation].\nThose who regard the TAO as heterodox appear as though belonging to the same class [as its true adherents].\nThe highest virtue resembles a ravine\u2014[in profundity].\nGreat virtue resembles ignominy [in that it is not the highest].\nWidespread virtue is as though insufficient.\nEstablished virtue appears like meanness [in the eyes of foolish men].\nThe purest [human] character, as though liable to excess.\nThe Great Square has no corners.\nThe Great Veseel takes long to complete.\nThe Great Sound is but seldom heard.\nThe Great Simulachrum has no form.\nTAO is imperceptible and nameless; and it is only TAO that excels in imparting itself [to men] and enabling them to achieve merit."},{chapter:42,content:"TAO produced the First\u2014[Heaven].\nThe First produced the Second\u2014[Earth].\nThese Two produced the Third.\nThe Third produced all things, and these turn their back upon the Yin and embrace the Yang. The intermingling of these two Afflati results in harmony.\nWhat men most hate is to be orphaned, widowed, and unworthy; and yet Princes and Dukes so style themselves. Wherefore, when things are diminished, they increase; and when they are increased, they diminish.\nWhat men teach me, that I teach them again. Violent and overbearing men never die a natural death. It is my object to instruct men as a father [nourishes his children]."},{chapter:43,content:"The weakest things in the world subjugate the strongest.\nThere are no men who persevere uninterruptedly [in the culture of TAO]. I know from this that in inaction there is advantage. There are few in the world who attain to teaching without words, or to the advantage that results from inaction."},{chapter:44,content:"Which is the more important\u2014one's reputation or one's body?\nWhich is the more valuable\u2014one's body or one's goods?\nWhich is the greater evil\u2014getting or losing?\nInordinate love cannot but result in the utter abandonment of its object [though eventual disgust]; and overhoarding cannot but result in heavy loss.\nHe who knows when he has enough does not lay himself open to shame. He who knows when to stop, will not incur danger. These two contain the elements of endurance."},{chapter:45,content:"The perfection of the great [TAO] is as though incomplete; its uses are inexhaustible.\nThe fullness of the great [TAO] is as though evaporating; its responsiveness [to requirements] is limitless.\nThe straightness of the great [TAO] is as though crooked.\nThe skilfulness of the great [TAO] has the appearance of stupidity.\nThe eloquence of the great [TAO] is as though defective of speech.\nRestlessness overcomes cold; quiescence overcomes heat. Purity and repose will make the whole world upright."},{chapter:46,content:"When the world is under the influence of TAO, [q.d., at peace], swift horses are discarded as so much ordure.\nWhen the world is without TAO, [q.d., in a state of war or anarchy], war-horses are born even in remote wilds; [they are bred everywhere].\nThere is no sin greater than that of permitting desire. There is no calamity greater than discontent. There is no fault greater than the desire of gain. Wherefore the sufficiency of those who are contented is an enduring sufficiency."},{chapter:47,content:"[There are those who] understand all about the Empire without going out of doors.[There are those who] see the course of Heaven without peeping through the lattice.\nThe further one goes [in pursuit of TAO] the less one knows of it.\nThus the Sage has knowledge without going in quest; he can identify things without seeing them; and he achieves results without working."},{chapter:48,content:"In pursuing the study [of TAO] there will be daily increase; in acting out the TAO [when learnt] there will be daily diminution.\nWhen this diminution is still further diminished, he will arrive at a state of inaction, or quiescence.\nThere is nothing that cannot be done by inaction.[The Sage] ever employs inaction in administering the Empire. As for those who put themselves to trouble in the matter, they are inadequate to the task of government."},{chapter:49,content:"The Sage's heart is not immutable; he regards the people's heart as his own.\nThe virtuous I encourage, or approve; the unvirtuous I would incite to virtue. The virtue [of the Sage] makes others virtuous.\nThe trustworthy I trust; the untrustworthy I would make trustworthy. The virtue [of the Sage] engenders trust.\nWhen the Sage occupies the throne of the Empire, he is anxiously bent on making it all of one mind. The people all fix their ears and eyes on him; and the Sage treats them as his children."},{chapter:50,content:"Men, in being born, emerge; in dying, they enter.\nThere are thirteen organs of life\u2014[the four limbs and nine openings].\nThere are thirteen causes of death\u2014[the departure of the three souls, the seven spirits, the vital force, the Yin and the Yang].\nThere are thirteen seats of death in the active life of men\u2014[the eight extremities of the compass and the five elements].\nAnd why is it thus? It is that the succession of births is a substantial [property of TAO].\nNow I have heard it said that a man who understands how to protect his life will never meet with rhinoceros or tiger while travelling by land; if he enters the army, he will not shrink from the weapons [of the enemy].\nThus the rhinoceros has nothing for his horn to attack, the tiger has nothing on which to stretch his claws, the soldier has no use for his blade. How is this to be accounted for? It is that the man keeps out of the reach of death."},{chapter:51,content:"What TAO produces, its Energy nourishes. The things [so produced and nourished] have form, which is determined by the nature of their surroundings; so that there is nothing in the whole world that does not reflect honour upon TAO and reverence upon its Energy.\nThe honour thus paid to the one, and the reverence paid to the other, is the result of no command; it is the ordinary and natural condition of things. Therefore what TAO produces, Energy nourishes. Everything is nurtured as it grows; is brought to maturity when complete; is protected while being fed.[TAO] produces without claiming merit; it works without presuming; it causes increase without destroying. This is called Sublime Virtue."},{chapter:52,content:"In the beginning of the world there was that which became the world's Mother.\nIf one knows the Mother, he will likewise recognise the offspring; and to the end of his days he will incur no danger.\nIf one represses his lustful inclinations and closes his door, he will be in quietude all his life: but if he gives rein to voluptuousness and indulges his desires, there will never be any salvation for him.\nHe who can perceive things that are minute is called clear-sighted. He who husbands his weakness is called resolute, or strongminded. He who uses the light that is in him will revert to his native perspicacity. Not exposing the body to disaster implies the practice of ethical morality."},{chapter:53,content:"Given that I am possessed of all-embracing knowledge, I act in accordance with the great TAO. Only, there is danger in conferring [this privilege] on others; for the great TAO is far removed, and the common people are addicted to walking in cross-roads.\nWhen the Imperial Court is devoid [of virtuous ministers], the fields will be entirely neglected, and the granaries entirely empty.\nTo dress in rich embroideries, to carry a sharp sword, to be wasteful in food and drink, and to have a superabundance of wealth and goods; this is to be what may be called a robber-chief; this is not TAO, indeed!"},{chapter:54,content:"The man who knows how to establish [virtue] never fears its being uprooted. The man who knows how to maintain [virtue] never fears its escaping him. The sons and grandsons of such never rest in offering sacrifices to them.\nThe virtue of him who cultivates TAO in his own person is genuine.\nThe virtue of him who cultivates it in his own home is superabundant [in that he has charity to spare for others].\nThe virtue of him who cultivates it in his village is enduring.\nThe virtue of him who cultivates it in his State is exuberant.\nThe virtue of him who cultivates it in the Empire is universal.\nWherefore I judge the persons of others by my own person; the families of others by my own family; the villages of others by my own village; the States of others by my own State; the Empire [of the ancient kings] by the Empire I rule to-day.\nHow do I know the acquiescence of the world [in the cultivation of TAO]?\u2014By this method."},{chapter:55,content:"He who possesses virtue inwardly may be compared to a new-born child. Venomous reptiles will not sting him, savage beasts will not lie in wait for him, birds of prey will not clutch at him; his bones are supple, his sinews pliable, so that he has a firm grip.\nBefore the principle of sexual connection was known, the [cosmic] embryo was formed; this was because the germinating essences [of the Yin and Yang] had come together.\nTo cry all day, and yet not become hoarse; this comes from the completion of the harmony.\nThe knowledge of this harmony may be called the basis or pivot [of virtue]; and knowledge of this basis is called enlightenment.\nWhen [TAO] is augmented, it will produce daily omens of good.\nWhen the heart dominates the vital energy, or breath, the man becomes daily stronger.\nWhen things, having become strong, straightway begin to age, this implies a divergence from TAO; those who are not in accord with TAO die early."},{chapter:56,content:"Those who know [the TAO] don't speak; those who speak do not know it.\nTo repress voluptuous desires, to close one's door, to chasten asperity, to unravel confusion, to moderate one's [internal] radiance, to identify oneself with the lowly; this may be called being in conformity with the Sublime.\nWherefore, others cannot be familiar with such, nor yet keep at a distance from them; cannot reap advantage from them, nor yet incur harm; cannot confer honour upon them, nor yet degrade them; and thus their honour comes from the whole world."},{chapter:57,content:'[The cultivator of TAO] uses uprightness in governing his State, exceptional sagacity in war, and inaction in obtaining the Empire.\nHow do I know that such is the case? By this:\u2014When there are many prohibitions in the Empire, the people become the more impoverished. When the people accumulate excess of wealth and goods, both State and family become gradually demoralised. When men are overskilful, the use of fantastical things gradually arises. When instruments of punishment gradually come into play, robbers increase in number.\nWherefore the Sage says, ""I do nothing, and the people reform of their own accord. I love quietude, and the people become spontaneously upright. I take no measures, and the people enrich themselves. I have no desires, and the people naturally become simple.""'},{chapter:58,content:"When the policy of administration is [apparently] inert, the people are liberal-minded and frank. When such policy is based on espionage the people are resentful and dissatisfied.\nHappiness is the correlate of calamity; calamity is ever hidden under happiness. Who can tell the boundary-line which divides one from the other?\nIf [the prince] be devoid of rectitude, the rectitude [of his people] will be turned into craft, and their goodness be turned into depravity.\nWhen the people are under delusion, the days [of their prince] cannot last long.\nTherefore the Sage is correct in his conduct, and never abandons [his correctness]; he is incorruptible, and never inflicts injury [by a bad example]; he is straightforward, and never acts at random; he shines [with internal radiance], but dazzles no one."},{chapter:59,content:"In governing men and serving Heaven, there is nothing equal to temperance. It is only by temperance that one may be said to submit betimes [to TAO]. Early submission [to TAO] implies a heavy accumulation of virtue. When virtue is thus heavily accumulated there is nothing to which the man is inadequate; when there is nothing to which a man is inadequate, it is impossible to know the limit of his resources; and the man whose resources are thus limitless, is fit to possess the State.\nThe possession of the Mother of the State [the principle of TAO] involves its long endurance. It may then be said to have a deep root and a solid stalk. This is the TAO which gives immortality and the power of long observing [the affairs of the world]."},{chapter:60,content:"To govern a great State as one fries a little fish\u2014q.d., without taking any trouble\u2014is to employ TAO in administering the Empire. The spirits of the departed are not [sacrificed to] as gods; neither are the spirits of those who do not belong to a man's own family.\nThe gods of the land do not inflict injury upon the inhabitants; nor do those which belong to other lands.\nThe Sage, also, inflicts no injury on his subjects; neither he nor they injure each other, so that the virtue of both unites and converges [in one direction]."},{chapter:61,content:"A great State is the rendezvous towards which the whole Empire converges; it is a Mother among all nations. The maternal or female principle, by means of quiescence, ever vanquishes [the inquietude of] the male principle.\nThe [prince], by a quiescent policy, makes himself humble.\nIt is for this reason that a great State, by bearing itself humbly towards a small State, gains its allegiance; and a small State, by bearing itself humbly towards a great State, may obtain possession of it. Thus an inferior [State] can either be taken by this means, or can itself take [a superior one].\nWhen a great State has no desire beyond protecting all its subjects equally, and a small State has no desire but to belong to [the greater one] and to serve its Prince, both will attain to the positions proper to each. Those who aspire to greatness must humble themselves."},{chapter:62,content:"TAO is the deep reservoir of all things. It is the jewel of the good man, the guardian of the bad.\nVirtuous words are marketable; honourable deeds may be made over to the credit of others. What reason is there for casting a man off on account of his being unvirtuous?\nWherefore, though the Emperor be enthroned, and his Ministers appointed, holding their jade badges of office in front of them and riding in a chariot and four: it would be better to remain seated in quiet, and to adopt, or enter into, this TAO.\nIt was this TAO that the ancients reverenced. Why do not [the rulers of to-day] strive daily to acquire it? The ancients taking the national sins upon themselves, their subjects put away their depravity; and therefore they were honoured by the whole Empire."},{chapter:63,content:"[The Sage] acts as though not acting. He occupies himself as though having nothing to do. He relishes that which is insipid\u2014the TAO.\nThe great, the small, the many, the few, [are all equal in his sight]. He recompenses injury with kindness. In setting about difficult tasks, he begins with what is easy. In performing great things, he begins with little ones.\nThe difficult affairs of the world must be begun from what is easy the great things of the world must be begun from what is small. That is why the Sage never sets about great undertakings and yet is able to accomplish great things.\nLightly made promises lead to very little faith [being placed in the promiser]. He to whom most things are very easy at first will certainly find many difficulties afterwards. Thus the Sage always recognises the existence of difficulty, and by this means he never experiences any difficulty in practice."},{chapter:64,content:"When [the State] is at peace, it is easily supported, or maintained. When portents have not yet appeared, it is easy to provide for [future contingencies]. When a thing is brittle, it is easily broken. When a thing is minute, it is easily dispersed.\nAct before pressing necessity for action arises. Govern well the State before anarchy breaks out. A tree which takes the arms of two men to span it, grew from a tiny sprout. A tower nine storeys high was raised from a mound of earth. A journey of a thousand li begins with a foot's pace.\nHe who acts, fails; he who grasps, loses. The Sage never acts, and therefore he never fails; he never grasps, and therefore he never loses.\nThe people, in their undertakings, frequently fail when they are on the verge of accomplishment. The cautious act towards the end of an undertaking as at the commencement; and that is why they never fail.\nThus the Sage desires as though he desired not; and attaches no value to things difficult of acquisition. He learns what others do not learn, and returns to what is passed over by the multitude. By this means he promotes the spontaneous development of all things, and that without venturing to act."},{chapter:65,content:"Those who, in ancient times, were eminent for the practice of TAO, abstained from enlightening the people, and kept them simple.\nThe difficulty of governing the people arises from their excess of shrewdness. He who employs shrewdness in governing a State, becomes a robber of the State; he who does not do so, is a blessing to it. The man who knows both these things presents an ideal of good government, and a knowledge of this ideal constitutes Sublime Virtue. Sublime Virtue is deep and far-reaching, and is in direct opposition to all objects of desire; thus it is able to bring about universal accordance [with TAO]."},{chapter:66,content:"The fact that rivers and seas are able to be rulers over all water-courses is due to their downward tendency. It is on account of this that they are able to dominate all waters. Therefore the Sage who desires to reign over the people must be retiring in demeanour. Then, when the Sage occupies a high position, his subjects will not be self-sufficient; when he leads the van, his subjects will not work injury [by disobedience or rebellion]. Thus it comes that the whole Empire delights to render him his dues, and that without reluctance, in that he never strives; therefore the Empire is unable to strive with him."},{chapter:67,content:"The inhabitants of the world all say that I am great [i.e., greatly tolerant], although I have the appearance of incompetence. This apparent incompetence is the result of my very greatness. In the case of one who is possessed of more than ordinary ability, he sets his mind constantly upon even the smallest matters.\nNow there are three things which I regard as precious, which I grasp and prize.\nThe first is compassion; the second is frugality; the third is not venturing to take precedence of others\u2014modesty.\nI prize compassion; therefore I am able to be fearless. I prize frugality; therefore I am able to be liberal. I prize modesty; therefore I am able to become a leader of men. But men of the present day abandon compassion, yet aim at valiancy; they abandon frugality, yet aim at being liberal; they abandon modesty, yet aim at leadership. This is death to them.\nNow when one is compassionate in battle, he will be victorious. When one is compassionate in defending, his defences will be strong. When Heaven intends to deliver men, it employs compassion to protect them."},{chapter:68,content:"Those eminent for scholarly virtues are not fighting men. Those eminent in war do not lose their temper. Those eminent for victory do not struggle. Those eminent for making use of others descend to their level.\nThis may be called the virtue which does not contend; the power of utilising men; the utmost limit that can be reached in equalling Heaven and the men of old."},{chapter:69,content:'There was a saying among the military commanders [of old]:\u2014""I do not venture to act the host\u2014q.d., to give battle; I prefer to be the guest\u2014to await the attack. I do not venture to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot."" This may be called operating negatively, and appropriating [the enemy\'s possessions] without infringing propriety. Were this policy pursued, there would be no withstanding [of our arms], and capture might be effected without striking a blow.\nThere is no greater calamity than that of despising an enemy. By underestimating the enemy one brings about the loss of [the three things] I prize. Wherefore when opposing forces meet in battle, it is the compassionate who conquer.'},{chapter:70,content:"My words are easy to understand, easy to put in practice; [yet] the world can neither understand nor practise them.\nMy words have an underlying intent; my actions have a ruling motive. It is only ignorance that causes men not to understand my doctrine.\nThose who understand me are few; those who copy me are worthy. Wherefore the Sage dresses in coarse robes while hiding a jewel in his breast."},{chapter:71,content:"Those who understand [the TAO] are up conscious of their upward progress. Those who count their ignorance as knowledge, are diseased. It is only those who treat themselves as sick who are therefore free from disease. The Sage, who is not diseased, treats himself as though he were; wherefore his disease becomes no disease at all."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people do not stand in awe of severe enactments, great visitations will befal [the State].\nWhen [a man] does not behave indecorously within doors, he will not inspire disgust in others. It is only when [the prince] does not inspire disgust that [his subjects] will submit to him without reluctance.\nWherefore is it that the Sage, though possessed of intuitive knowledge, yet makes no self-display; respects, but does not exalt himself; thus adopting the one course and avoiding the other."},{chapter:73,content:"When bravery is pushed to rashness, a man will incur a violent death. When courage is tempered by caution, he will preserve his life.\nThese two conditions result, the one in benefit, the other in injury. Who knows the cause of Heaven's animosity [to either]? Thus it is that even the Sage here sees a difficulty.\nThe TAO of Heaven never strives, yet excels in victory; it speaks not, yet excels in responding [to desert]; it beckons not, yet [things] come to it of their own accord; it lies concealed, yet excels in organising. The net of Heaven extends everywhere. Its meshes are wide, but nothing ever escapes it."},{chapter:74,content:"If people do not fear death why attempt to frighten them by capital punishment?\nSupposing the people are made constantly afraid of death, so that when they commit unlawful acts I arrest them and have them killed, who will dare [afterwards to misbehave]? For then there will always be yiu-sze, or civil magistrates, to execute them. Now the execution of men on behalf of the inflictor of the death-punishment [by those not legally qualified to do so] may be compared to hewing on behalf of a master carpenter; and people who [attempt to] hew instead of a master carpenter mostly cut their hands."},{chapter:75,content:"The hunger of the people is due to the exorbitant taxation levied by their rulers. That is why they starve.\nThe difficulty of governing the people arises from the policy of action adopted by their rulers. That is why government is difficult. The light esteem in which people hold death is due to the over-anxiety with which they struggle for life. That is why they hold death so cheap. It is only those who do not exert themselves on behalf of their life that know how to hold life in true honour; [or, who are superior to those who hold life in too high esteem]."},{chapter:76,content:"Men, when born, are weak and soft; when dead, they are stiff and hard.\nWhen inanimate objects\u2014say, the vegetable creation\u2014are first produced, they are soft and tender; when dead, they are hard and dry.\nWherefore hardness and rigidity are associated with death; softness and weakness with life. So, when soldiers are violent, they gain no victories; when the tree is strong, a combination of strength is used [to fell it]. Its big parts are below; its soft and tender parts above."},{chapter:77,content:"The TAO of Heaven resembles a drawn bow. It brings down the high and exalts the lowly; it takes from those who have superfluity, and gives to those who have not enough. The TAO of Heaven abstracts where there is too much, and supplements where there is deficiency.\nThe TAO of men does not so. It takes away from what is already deficient in order to bestow on those who have a superfluity. Who is able to devote his surplus to the needs of others?\u2014Only he who is possessed of TAO.\nThus it is that the Sage acts, yet does not plume himself; achieves works of merit, yet does not hold to them. He has no wish to make a display of his worthiness."},{chapter:78,content:"There is nothing under Heaven that is weaker or softer than water; yet those who attack what is hard and strong are not aware that it is [the soft and weak] that can overcome it.[Thus] they do not see that, their task is an easy one.\nThe fact that weakness overcomes strength, that the soft overcomes the hard, is unknown to none; yet they cannot act upon it.\nTherefore the Sage says: He who bears the reproach of the State may be called lord of the nation's altars; he who bears the calamities of the State may be called the King of the world. These are true words, though apparently at variance [with reason]; i.e., paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When peace is made after a great quarrel, there is always a feeling of resentment left behind.

But propriety in itself is little more than the counterfeit of sincerity and truth, and becomes in consequence the frequent cause of confusion and disorder.\nFrom this it will be seen, that when we study the past it presents itself to us under two distinct aspects - that of a flower from God's own hand, and that of the commencement of human folly, and so it is that the Superior man seeks to establish himself on a firm and substantial basis, and to avoid all that is weak and frivolous.

Doors and windows are cut out in order to make a house; the utility of the house depends on the empty spaces.\nThus, while the existence of things may be good, it is the non-existent in them which makes them serviceable."},{chapter:12,content:"A variety of colours makes man's eye blind; a diversity of sounds makes man's ear deaf; a mixture of flavours makes man's palate dull.\nRacing and hunting excite man's heart to madness.\nThe struggle for rare possessions drives a man to actions injurious to himself.\nThe Sage attends to the inner and not to the outer; he puts away the objective and holds to the subjective."},{chapter:13,content:'A Sage has said: ""He who can take upon himself the nation\'s shame is fit to be lord of the land. He who can take upon himself the nation\'s calamities is fit to be ruler over the Empire.""\nHe who respects the State as his own person is fit to govern it. He who loves the State as his own body is fit to be entrusted with it.'},{chapter:14,content:"Tao eludes the sense of sight, and is therefore called colourless. It eludes the sense of hearing, and is therefore called soundless. It eludes the sense of touch, and is therefore called incorporeal. These three qualities cannot be apprehended, and hence they may be blended into unity.\nIts upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in action, it cannot be named, but returns again to nothingness. We may call it the form of the formless, the image of the imageless, the fleeting and the indeterminable. Would you go before it, you cannot see its face; would you go behind it, you cannot see its back.\n"},{chapter:15,content:"The skilful philosophers of the olden time were subtle, spiritual, profound, and penetrating. They were so deep as to be incomprehensible. Because they are hard to comprehend, I will endeavour to describe them.\nShrinking were they, like one fording a stream in winter. Cautious were they, like one who fears an attack from any quarter. Circumspect were they, like a stranger guest; self-effacing, like ice about to melt; simple, like unpolished wood; vacant, like a valley; opaque, like muddy water.\nWho is there that can make muddy water clear? But if allowed to remain still, it will gradually become dear of itself. Who is there that can secure a state of absolute repose? But let time go on, and the state of repose will gradually arise. Be sparing of speech, and things will come right of themselves.\n"},{chapter:16,content:"Attain complete vacuity, and sedulously preserve a state of repose.\nAll things alike do their work, and then we see them subside. When they have reached their bloom, each returns to its origin. Returning to their origin means rest or fulfilment of destiny. This reversion is an eternal law. To know that law is to be enlightened. Not to know it, is misery and calamity. He who knows the eternal law is liberal-minded. Being liberal-minded, he is just. Being just, he is kingly. Being kingly, he is akin to Heaven. Being akin to Heaven, he possesses Tao. Possessed of Tao, he endures for ever. Though his body perish, yet he suffers no harm.\n"},{chapter:17,content:'In the highest antiquity, the people did not know that they had rulers. In the next age they loved and praised them. In the next, they feared them. In the next, they despised them.\nHe who has not faith in others shall find no faith in them.\nHow cautious is the Sage, how sparing of his words! When this task is accomplished and affairs are prosperous, the people all say: ""We have come to be as we are, naturally and of ourselves.'},{chapter:18,content:"When the Great Tao falls into disuse, benevolence and righteousness come into vogue. When shrewdness and sagacity appear, great hypocrisy prevails. It is when the bonds of kinship are out of joint that filial piety and paternal affection begin. It is when the State is in a ferment of revolution that loyal patriots arise."},{chapter:19,content:"Cast off your holiness, rid yourself of sagacity, and the people will benefit an hundredfold. Discard benevolence and abolish righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and paternal love. Renounce your scheming and abandon gain, and thieves and robbers will disappear. These three precepts mean that outward show is insufficient, and therefore they bid us be true to our proper nature;\u2014to show simplicity, to embrace plain dealing, to reduce selfishness, to moderate desire."},{chapter:20,content:"Abandon learning, and you will be free from trouble and distress.\nBetween yes and yea, how small the difference! Between good and evil, how great the difference!\n\nAll men are radiant with happiness, as if enjoying a great feast, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone am still, and give as yet no sign of joy. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled, forlorn as one who has nowhere to lay his head. Other men have plenty, while I alone seem to have lost all. I am a man foolish in heart, dull and confused. Other men are full of light; I alone seem to be in darkness. Other men are alert; I alone am listless. I am unsettled as the ocean, drifting as though I had no stopping-place. All men have their usefulness; I alone am stupid and clownish. Lonely though I am and unlike other men, yet I revere the Foster-Mother, Tao."},{chapter:21,content:"Tao in itself is vague, impalpable,\u2014how impalpable, how vague! Yet within it there is Form. How vague, how impalpable! Yet within it there is Substance. How profound, how obscure! Yet within it there is a Vital Principle. This principle is the Quintessence of Reality, and out of it comes Truth.\nFrom of old until now, its name has never passed away. It watches over the beginning of all things. How do I know this about the beginning of things? Through Tao."},{chapter:22,content:"He that humbles himself shall be preserved entire. He that bends shall be made straight. He that is empty shall be filled. He that is worn out shall be renewed. He who has little shall succeed. He who has much shall go astray.\nTherefore the Sage embraces Unity, and is a model for all under Heaven. He is free from self-display, therefore he shines forth; from self-assertion, therefore he is distinguished; from self-glorification, therefore he has merit; from self-exaltation, therefore he rises superior to all. Inasmuch as he does not strive, there is no one in the world who can strive with him."},{chapter:23,content:"A violent wind does not outlast the morning; a squall of rain does not outlast the day. Such is the course of Nature. And if Nature herself cannot sustain her efforts long, how much less can man!\nHe who acts in accordance with Tao, becomes one with Tao, He who treads the path of Virtue becomes one with Virtue. He who pursues a course of Vice becomes one with Vice. The man who is one with Tao, Tao is also glad to receive. The man who is one with Virtue, Virtue is also glad to receive. The man who is one with Vice, Vice is also glad to receive."},{chapter:24,content:"He who raises himself on tiptoe cannot stand firm; he who stretches his legs wide apart cannot walk.\nHe who is self-approving does not shine. He who boasts has no merit. He who exalts himself does not rise high. Judged according to Tao, he is like remnants of food or a tumour on the body\u2014an object of universal disgust. Therefore one who has Tao will not consort with such."},{chapter:25,content:"There is something, chaotic yet complete, which existed before Heaven and Earth. Oh, how still it is, and formless, standing alone without changing, reaching everywhere without suffering harm I It must be regarded as the Mother of the Universe. Its name I know not. To designate it, I call it Tao. Endeavouring to describe it, I call it Great. Being great, it passes on; passing on, it becomes remote; having become remote, it returns.\nTherefore Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the Sovereign also is great. In the Universe there are four powers, of which the Sovereign is one. Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from Tao; but the law of Tao is its own spontaneity."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is the foundation of the light; repose is the ruler of unrest.\nThe wise prince in his daily course never departs from gravity and repose. Though he possess a gorgeous palace, he will dwell therein with calm indifference. How should the lord of a myriad chariots conduct himself with levity in the Empire? Levity loses men's hearts; unrest loses the throne."},{chapter:27,content:"The skilful traveller leaves no tracks; the skilful speaker makes no blunders; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies. He who knows how to shut uses no bolts\u2014yet you cannot open. He who knows bow to bind uses no cords\u2014yet you cannot undo.\nEven if a man is bad, how can it be right to cast him off?\nAmong men, reject none; among things, reject; nothing. This is called comprehensive intelligence.\nThe good man is the bad man's teacher; the bad man is the material upon which the good man works. If the one does not value his teacher, if the other does not love his material, I then despite their sagacity they must go far I astray. This is a mystery of great import."},{chapter:28,content:"He who, conscious of being strong, is content to be weak,\u2014he shall be the paragon of mankind. Being the paragon of mankind, Virtue will never desert him. He returns to the state of a little child.\nHe who, conscious of his own light, is content to be obscure,\u2014he shall be the whole world's model. Being the whole world's model, his Virtue will never fail. He reverts to the Absolute.\nHe who, conscious of desert, is content to suffer disgrace,\u2014he shall be the cynosure of mankind. Being the cynosure of mankind, his Virtue then is full. He returns to perfect simplicity.\nAs unwrought material is divided up and made into serviceable vessels, so the Sage turns his simplicity to account, and thereby becomes the ruler of rulers."},{chapter:29,content:"If any one desires to take the Empire in hand and govern it, I see that he will not succeed. The Empire is a divine utensil which may not be roughly handled. He who meddles, mars. He who holds it by force, loses it.\nThe course of things is such that what was in front is now behind; what was hot is now cold; what was strong is now weak; what was complete is now in ruin. Therefore the Sage avoids excess, extravagance, and grandeur."},{chapter:30,content:"HE who serves a ruler of men in harmony with Tao will not subdue the Empire by force of arms. Such a course is wont to bring retribution in its train.\nWhere troops have been quartered, brambles and thorns spring up. In the track of great armies there must follow lean years.\nThe good man wins a victory and then stops; he will not go on to acts of violence. Winning, he boasteth not; he will not triumph; he shows no arrogance. He wins because he cannot choose; after his victory he will not be overbearing.\nThings wax strong and then decay. This is the contrary of Tao. What is contrary to Tao soon perishes."},{chapter:31,content:"Weapons, however beautiful, are instruments of ill omen, hateful to all creatures. Therefore he who has Tao will have nothing to do with them.\nWhere the princely man abides, the weak left hand is in honour. But he who uses weapons honours the stronger right. Weapons are instruments of ill omen; they are not the instruments of the princely man, who uses them only when he needs must. Peace and tranquillity are what he prizes. When he conquers, he is not elate. To De elate were to rejoice in the slaughter of human beings. And he who rejoices in the slaughter of human beings is not fit to work his will in the Empire.\nOn happy occasions, the left is favoured; on sad occasions, the right. The second in command has his place on the left, the general in chief on the right. That is to say, they are placed in the order observed at funeral rites. And, indeed, he who has exterminated a great multitude of men should bewail them with tears and lamentation. It is well that those who are victorious in battle should be placed in the order of funeral rites."},{chapter:32,content:"Tao in its unchanging aspect has no name. Small though it be in its primordial simplicity, mankind dare not claim its service. Could princes and kings hold and keep it, all creation would spontaneously pay homage. Heaven and Earth would unite in sending down sweet dew, and the people would be righteous unbidden and of their own accord.\n\nTao as it exists in the world is like the great rivers and seas which receive the streams from the valleys."},{chapter:33,content:"He who knows others is clever, but he who knows himself is enlightened. He who overcomes others is strong, but he who overcomes himself is mightier still. \nTo see oneself is to be dear of sight. Mighty is he who conquers himself.\nHe is rich who knows when he has enough. He who acts with energy has strength of purpose. He who moves not from his proper place is long-lasting. He who dies, but perishes not, enjoys true longevity."},{chapter:34,content:"All-pervading is the Great Tao. It can be at once on the right hand and on the left. All things depend on it for life, and it rejects them not. Its task accomplished, it takes no credit. It loves and nourishes all things, but does not act as master. It is ever free from desire. We may call it small. All things return to it, yet it does not act as master. We may call it great.\nThe Sage never affects to do anything great, and therefore he is able to achieve his great results."},{chapter:35,content:"The whole world will flock to him who holds the mighty form of Tao. They will come and receive no hurt, but find rest, peace, and tranquillity.\nWith music and dainties we may detain the passing guest. But if we open our mouths to speak of Tao, he finds it tasteless and insipid.\nNot visible to the sight, not audible to the ear, in its use it is inexhaustible."},{chapter:36,content:"If you would contract, you must first expand. If you would weaken, you must first strengthen. If you would overthrow, you must first raise up. If you would take, you must first give. This is called the dawn of intelligence.\nFishes must not be taken from the water: the methods of government must not be exhibited to the people."},{chapter:37,content:"Tao is eternally inactive, and yet it leaves nothing undone. If kings and princes could but hold fast to this principle, all things would work out their own reformation. If, having reformed, they still desired to act, I would have them restrained by the simplicity of the Nameless Tao. The simplicity of the Nameless Tao brings about an absence of desire. The absence of desire gives tranquillity. And thus the Empire will rectify itself."},{chapter:38,content:"Perfect Virtue acquires nothing; therefore it obtains everything. Perfect Virtue does nothing, yet there is nothing which it does not effect. Perfect Charity operates without the need of anything to evoke it. Perfect Duty to one's neighbour operates, but always needs to be evoked. Perfect Ceremony operates, and calls for no outward response; nevertheless it induces respect.\nIf Tao perishes, then Virtue will perish; if Virtue perishes, then Charity will perish; if Charity perishes, then Duty to one's neighbour will perish; if Duty to one's neighbour perishes, then Ceremonies will perish.\nCeremonies are but the veneer of loyalty and good faith, while oft-times the source of disorder. Knowledge of externals is but a showy ornament of Tao, while oft-times the beginning of imbecility.\nTherefore the truly great man takes his stand upon what is solid, and not upon what is superficial; upon what is real, and not upon what is ornamental. He rejects the latter in favour of the former."},{chapter:39,content:'He who is great must make humility his base. He who is high must make lowliness his foundation. Thus, princes and kings in speaking of themselves use the terms ""lonely,"" ""friendless,"" ""of small account."" Is not this making humility their base?\nDo not wish to be rare like jade, or common like stone.'},{chapter:40,content:"Retrogression is the movement of Tao. Weakness is the character of Tao.\nAll things under Heaven derive their being from Tao in the form of Existence; Tao in the form of Existence sprang from Tao in the form of Non-Existence."},{chapter:41,content:"When the superior scholar hears of Tao, he diligently practises it. When the average scholar hears of Tao, he sometimes retains it, sometimes loses it. When the inferior scholar hears of Tao, he loudly laughs at it. Were it not thus ridiculed, it would not be worthy of the name of Tao.\nHe who is enlightened by Tao seems wrapped in darkness. He who is advanced in Tao seems to be going back. He who walks smoothly in Tao seems to be on a rugged path\n\nTao is a great square with no angles, a great vessel which takes long to complete, a great sound which cannot be heard, a great image with no form.\nTao lies hid and cannot be named, yet it has the power of transmuting and perfecting all things."},{chapter:42,content:'Tao produced Unity; Unity produced Duality; Duality produced Trinity; and Trinity produced all existing objects.) These myriad objects leave darkness behind them and embrace the light, being harmonised by the breath of Vacancy.\nHe who is great must make humility his base. He who is high must make lowliness his foundation. Thus, princes and kings in speaking of themselves use the terms ""lonely,"" ""friendless,"" ""of small account."" Is not this making humility their base?\nThus it is that ""Some things are increased by being diminished, others are diminished by being increased."" What others have taught, I also teach; verily, I will make it the root of my teaching.'},{chapter:43,content:"The softest things in the world override the hardest. That which has no substance enters where there is no crevice. Hence I know the advantage of inaction.\nConveying lessons without words, reaping profit without action,\u2014there are few in the world who can attain to this!"},{chapter:44,content:"Which is nearer to you, fame or life? Which is more to you, life or wealth? Which is the greater malady, gain or loss?\nExcessive ambitions necessarily entail great sacrifice. Much hoarding must be followed by heavy loss. He who knows when he has enough will not be put to shame. He who knows when to stop will not come to harm. Such a man can look forward to long life."},{chapter:45,content:"He who is most perfect seems to be lacking; yet his resources are never outworn. He who is most full seems vacant; yet his uses are inexhaustible.\nExtreme straightness is as bad as crookedness. Extreme cleverness is as bad as folly. Extreme fluency is as bad as stammering.\nActivity conquers cold, but stillness conquers heat. Purity and stillness are the correct principles for mankind."},{chapter:46,content:"If Tao prevails on earth, horses will be used for purposes of agriculture. If Tao does not prevail, war-horses will be bred on the common.\n\n\nThere is no sin greater than ambition; no calamity greater than discontent; no vice more sickening than covetousness. He who is content always has enough."},{chapter:47,content:"Without going out of doors one may know the whole world; without looking out of the window, one may see the Way of Heaven. The further one travels, the less one may know. Thus it is that without moving you shall know; without looking you shall see; without doing you shall achieve."},{chapter:48,content:"The pursuit of book-learning brings about daily increase. The practice of Tao brings about daily loss. Repeat this loss again and again, and you arrive at inaction. Practise inaction, and there is nothing which cannot be done.\nThe Empire has ever been won by letting things take their course. He who must always be doing is unfit to obtain the Empire."},{chapter:49,content:"To the good I would be good; to the not-good I would also be good, in order to make them good.\nWith the faithful I would keep faith; with the unfaithful I would also keep faith, in order that they may become faithful.\nThe Sage has no hard and fast ideas, but he shares the ideas of the people and makes them his own. Living in the world, he is apprehensive lest his heart be sullied by contact with the world. The people all fix their eyes and ears upon him. The Sage looks upon all as his children."},{chapter:50,content:"I have heard that he who possesses the secret of life, when travelling abroad, will not flee from rhinoceros or tiger; when entering a hostile camp, he will not equip himself with sword or buckler. The rhinoceros finds in him no place to insert its horn; the tiger has nowhere to fasten its claw; the soldier has nowhere to thrust his blade. And why? Because he has no spot where death can enter."},{chapter:51,content:"Hence there is not a single thing but pays homage to Tao and extols its Virtue. This homage paid to Tao, this extolling of its Virtue, is due to no command, but is always spontaneous. Thus it is that Tao, engendering all things, nourishes them, develops them, and fosters them, perfects them, ripens them, tends them, and protects them. Production without possession, action without self-assertion, development without domination: this is its mysterious operation."},{chapter:52,content:"The World has a First Cause, which may be regarded as the Mother of the World. When one has the Mother, one can know the Child. He who knows the Child and still keeps the Mother, though his body perish, shall run no risk of harm.\nKeep the mouth shut, close the gateways of sense, and as long as you live you will have no trouble. Open your lips and push your affairs, and you will not be safe to the end of your days.\nTo see small beginnings is clearness of sight. To rest in weakness is strength.\nUse the light that is in you to revert to your natural clearness of sight. Then the loss of the body is unattended by calamity. This is called doubly enduring."},{chapter:53,content:"If we had sufficient knowledge to walk in the Great Way, what we should most fear would be boastful display.\nThe Great Way is very smooth, but the people love the by-paths.\nWhere the palaces are very splendid, there the fields will be very waste, and the granaries very empty.\nThe wearing of gay embroidered robes, the carrying of sharp swords, fastidiousness in food and drink, superabundance of property and wealth:\u2014this I call flaunting robbery; most assuredly it is not Tao."},{chapter:54,content:"He who knows how to plant, shall not have his plant uprooted; he who knows how to hold a thing, shall not have it taken away. Sons and grandsons will worship at his shrine, which shall endure from generation to generation."},{chapter:55,content:"He who trusts to his abundance of natural virtue is like an infant newly born, whom venomous reptiles will not sting, wild beasts will not seize, birds of prey will not strike. The infant's bones are weak, its sinews are soft, yet its grasp is firm. All day long it will cry without its voice becoming hoarse. This is because the harmony of its bodily system is perfect.\nKnowledge in harmony is called constant. Constant knowledge is called wisdom. Increase of life is called felicity. The mind directing the body is called strength.\nThings wax strong and then decay. This is the contrary of Tao. What is contrary to Tao soon perishes."},{chapter:56,content:"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Temper your sharpness, disentangle your ideas, moderate your brilliancy, live in harmony with your age. This is being in conformity with the principle of Tao. Such a man is impervious alike to favour and disgrace, to benefits and injuries, to honour and contempt. And therefore he is esteemed above all mankind."},{chapter:57,content:'Use uprightness in ruling a State; employ stratagems in waging war; practise non-interference in order to win the Empire. Now this is how I know what I lay down:\u2014\nAs restrictions and prohibitions are multiplied in the Empire, the people grow poorer and poorer. When the people are subjected to overmuch government, the land is thrown into confusion. When the people are skilled in many cunning arts, strange are the objects of luxury that appear.\nThe greater the number of laws and enactments, the more thieves and robbers there will be. Therefore the Sage says: ""So long as I do nothing, the people will work out their own reformation. So long as I love calm, the people will right themselves. If only I keep from meddling, the people will grow rich. If only I am free from desire, the people will come naturally back to simplicity.'},{chapter:58,content:"If the government is sluggish and tolerant, the people will be honest and free from guile. If the government is prying and meddling, there will be constant infraction of the law. Is the government corrupt? \nFailure is the foundation of success, and the means by which it is achieved. Success is the lurking-place of failure; but who can tell when the turning-point will come?\nThen uprightness becomes rare, and goodness becomes strange. Verily, mankind have been under delusion for many a day!\nBe square without being angular. Be honest without being mean. Be upright without being punctilious. Be brilliant without being showy."},{chapter:59,content:"In governing men and in serving Heaven, there is nothing like moderation. For only by moderation can there be an early return to man's normal state. This early return is the same as a great storage of Virtue. With a great storage of Virtue there is naught which may not be achieved. If there is naught which may not be achieved, then no one will know to what extent this power reaches. And if no one knows to what extent a man's power reaches, that man is fit to be the ruler of a State. Having the secret of rule, his rule shall endure. Setting the tap-root deep, and making the spreading roots firm: this is the way to ensure long life to the tree."},{chapter:60,content:"Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish.\nIf the Empire is governed according to Tao, disembodied spirits will not manifest supernatural powers. It is not that they lack supernatural power, but they will not use it to hurt mankind. Again, it is not that they are unable to hurt mankind, but they see that the Sage also does not hurt mankind. If then neither Sage nor spirits work harm, their virtue converges to one beneficent end."},{chapter:61,content:"What makes a kingdom great is its being like a down-flowing river,\u2014the central point towards which all the smaller streams under Heaven converge; or like the female throughout the world, who by quiescence always overcomes the male. And quiescence is a form of humility.\nTherefore, if a great kingdom humbles itself before a small kingdom, it shall make that small kingdom its prize. And if a small kingdom humbles itself before a great kingdom, it shall win over that great kingdom. Thus the one humbles itself in order to attain, the other attains because it is humble. If the great kingdom has no further desire than to bring men together and to nourish them, the small kingdom will have no further desire than to enter the service of the other. But in order that both may have their desire, the great one must learn humility."},{chapter:62,content:"Tao is the sanctuary where all things find refuge, the good man's priceless treasure, the guardian and saviour of him who is not good. \nGood words shall gain you honour in the market-place, but good deeds shall gain you friends among men.\nHence at the enthronement of an Emperor and the appointment of his three ducal ministers, though there be some who bear presents of costly jade and drive chariots with teams of four horses, that is not so good as sitting still and offering the gift of this Tao.\nWhy was it that the men of old esteemed this Tao so highly? Is it not because it may be daily sought and found, and can remit the sins of the guilty? Hence it is the most precious thing under Heaven."},{chapter:63,content:"Practise inaction, occupy yourself with doing nothing. \nRequite injury with kindness.\n\nThe difficult things of this world must once have been easy; the great things of this world must once have been small. Set about difficult things while they are still easy; do great things while they are still small. The Sage never affects to do anything great, and therefore he is able to achieve his great results.\nHe who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith.\nHe who always thinks things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the Sage ever anticipates difficulties, and thus it is he never encounters them.\n\n"},{chapter:64,content:"The tree which needs two arms to span its girth sprang from the tiniest shoot. Yon tower, nine storeys high, rose from a little mound of earth. A journey of a thousand miles began with a single step.\nHe who acts, destroys; he who grasps, loses. '. Therefore the Sage does not act, and so does not destroy; he does not grasp, and so he does not lose.\nIn the management of affairs, people constantly break down just when they are nearing a successful issue. If they took as much care at the end as at the beginning, they would not fail in their enterprises.\nDesire not to desire, and you will not value things difficult to obtain. Learn not to learn, and you will revert to a condition which mankind in general has lost."},{chapter:65,content:"In ancient times those who knew how to practise Tao did not use it to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them ignorant. The difficulty of governing the people arises from their having too much knowledge.\nHe who tries to govern a kingdom by his sagacity is of that kingdom the despoiler; but he who does not govern by sagacity is the kingdom's blessing. He who understands these two sayings may he regarded as a pattern and a model. To keep this principle constantly before one's eyes is called Profound Virtue. Profound Virtue is unfathomable, far-reaching, paradoxical at first, but afterwards exhibiting thorough conformity with Nature."},{chapter:66,content:"The reason why rivers and seas are able to be lords over a hundred mountain streams, is that they know how to keep below them. That is why they are able to reign over all the mountain streams.\nTherefore the Sage, wishing to be above the people, must by his words put himself below them; wishing to be before the people, he must put himself behind them. In this way, though he has his place above them, the people do not feel his weight; though he has his place before them, they do not feel it as an injury. Therefore all mankind delight to exalt him, and weary of him not. The Sage expects no recognition for what he does; he achieves merit but does not take it to himself; he does not wish to display his worth."},{chapter:67,content:"All the world says that my Tao is great, but unlike other teaching. It is just because it is great that it appears unlike other teaching. If it had this likeness, long ago would its smallness have been known.\nI have three precious things, which I hold fast and prize. The first is gentleness; the second is frugality; the third is humility, which keeps me from putting myself before others. Be gentle and you can be bold; be frugal, and you can be liberal; avoid putting yourself before others, and you can become a leader among men.\nBut in the present day men cast off gentleness, and are all for being bold; they spurn frugality, and retain only extravagance; they discard humility, and aim only at being first. Therefore they shall surely perish.\nGentleness brings victory to him who attacks, and safety to him who defends. Those whom Heaven would save, it fences round with gentleness."},{chapter:68,content:"The best soldiers are not warlike; the best fighters do not lose their temper. The greatest conquerors are those who overcome their enemies without strife. The greatest directors of men are those who yield place to others. This is called the Virtue of not striving, the capacity for directing mankind; this is being the compeer of Heaven. It was the highest goal of the ancients."},{chapter:69,content:'A certain military commander used to say: ""I dare not act the host; I prefer to play the guest. I dare not advance an inch; I prefer to retreat a foot.""\n\n\nThere is no greater calamity than lightly engaging in war. Lightly to engage in war is to risk the loss of our treasure.\nWhen opposing warriors join in battle, he who has pity conquers.'},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand, very easy to put into practice; yet the world can neither understand nor practise them.\nMy words have a clue, my actions have an underlying principle. It is because men do not know the clue that they understand me not.\nThose who know me are but few, and on that account my honour is the greater.\nThus the Sage wears coarse garments, but carries a jewel in his bosom."},{chapter:71,content:"To know, but to be as though not knowing, is the height of wisdom. Not to know, and yet to affect knowledge, is a vice. If we regard this vice as such, we shall escape it. The Sage has not this vice. It is because he regards it as a vice that he escapes it."},{chapter:72,content:"If the people do not fear the majesty of government, a reign of terror will ensue. Do not confine them within too narrow bounds; do not make their lives too weary. For if you do not weary them of life, then they will not grow weary of you.\nThe Sage knows what is in him, but makes no display; he respects himself, but seeks not honour for himself."},{chapter:73,content:"He whose boldness leads him to venture, will be slain; he who is brave enough not to venture, will live. Of these two, one has the benefit, the other has the hurt. But who is it that knows the real cause of Heaven's hatred? This is why the Sage hesitates and finds it difficult to act. The violent and stiff-necked die not by a natural death.\nIt is the Way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it knows how to overcome; not to speak, and yet it knows how to obtain a response; it calls not, and things come of themselves; it is slow to move, but excellent in its designs.\nHeaven's net is vast; though its meshes are wide, it lets nothing slip through."},{chapter:74,content:"If the people do not fear death, what good is there in using death as a deterrent? But if the people are brought up in fear of death, and we can take and execute any man who has committed a monstrous crime, who will dare to follow his example?\nNow, there is always one who presides over the infliction of death. He who would take the place of the magistrate and himself inflict death, is like one who should try to do the work of a master-carpenter. And of those who try the work of a master-carpenter there are few who do not cut their own hands."},{chapter:75,content:"The people starve because those in authority over them devour too many taxes; that is why they starve. The people are difficult to govern because those placed over them are meddlesome; that is why they are difficult to govern. The people despise death because of their excessive labour in seeking the means of life; that is why they despise death.\nOnly he who does nothing for his life's sake can truly be said to value his life."},{chapter:76,content:"Man at his birth is tender and weak; at his death he is rigid and strong. Plants and trees when they come forth are tender and crisp; when dead, they are dry and tough. Thus rigidity and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness are the concomitants of life.\nHence the warrior that is strong does not conquer; the tree that is strong is cut down. Therefore the strong and the big take the lower place; the soft and the weak take the higher place."},{chapter:77,content:"The Way of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow: it brings down what is high and raises what is low.\nIt is the Way of Heaven to take from those who have too much, and give to those who have too little. But the way of man is not so. He takes away from those who have too little, to add to his own superabundance. What man is there that can take of his own superabundance and give it to mankind? Only he who possesses Tao.\nThe Sage expects no recognition for what he does; he achieves merit but does not take it to himself; he does not wish to display his worth."},{chapter:78,content:'There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, yet for attacking things that are hard and strong there is nothing that surpasses it, nothing that can take its place.\nThe soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. There is no one in the world but knows this truth, and no one who can put it into practice.\nA Sage has said: ""He who can take upon himself the nation\'s shame is fit to be lord of the land. He who can take upon himself the nation\'s calamities is fit to be ruler over the Empire.""\nThe truest sayings are paradoxical.'},{chapter:79,content:"When terms are made after a great quarrel, a certain ill-feeling is bound to be left behind. How can this be made good? Therefore, having entered into an agreement, the Sage adheres to his obligations, but does not exact fulfilment from others. The man who has Virtue attends to the spirit of the compact; the man without Virtue attends only to his claims.\nThe Tao of Heaven has no favourites. It gives to all good men without distinction!"},{chapter:80,content:"Were I ruler of a little State with a small population, and only ten or a hundred men available as soldiers, I would not use them. I would have the people look on death as a grievous thing, and they should not travel to distant countries. Though they might possess boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them. Though they might own weapons and armour, they should have no need to use them. I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords. They should find their plain food sweet, their rough garments fine. They should be content with their homes, and happy in their simple ways. If a neighbouring State was within sight of mine\u2014nay, if we were dose enough to hear the crowing of each other's cocks and the barking of each other's dogs\u2014the two peoples should grow old and die without there ever having been any mutual intercourse."},{chapter:81,content:"True words are not fine; fine words are not true.\nThe good are not contentious; the contentious are not good.\nThose who are wise have no wide range of learning; those who range most widely are not wise.\nThe Sage does not care to hoard. The more he uses for the benefit of others, the more he possesses himself. The more he gives to his fellow-men, the more he has of his own.\nThis is the Way of Heaven, which benefits, and injures not.

best,\nFor with it they handle sword, and spear, and knife.\nThey are tools of evil omen, not for the superior man,\nWho will only keep and use them when he must,\nFor peace and quietude are what he prizes most,\nAnd victory is only good when just.\nTo delight in victory is to delight in scenes of blood,\nWhere myriads to sudden death are hurled,\nAnd the man who thus enjoys is never fit for power or place,\nAnd will fail to hold possession in the world.\nIn prosperous affairs the left is honored most,\nBut in matters of adversity the right,\nSo the second in command of the army takes the left,\nAnd the opposite the one of greater might.\nSo the order is, I say, just as at a funeral,\nAnd justly so, for who has thousands slain,\nShould weep for those who fell with the bitterness of grief,\nAs he passes with his melancholy train."},{chapter:32,content:"The eternal Tao is nameless; though it be\nToo insignificant a name to have,\nIn its primordial simplicity\nThe whole world dare

to change again still come to be,\nI would quiet such desire by the Nameless One's simplicity,\nBut the Nameless One's simplicity is free from all desire,\nSo tranquilly, of their own accord, all things would still transpire."},{chapter:38,content:"The highest virtue is un-virtue, therefore it has virtue,\nInferior virtue virtue loses not, and so has none,\nThe highest virtue is non-action, and thereby does nothing,\nInferior virtue acts it, and exists by acting done.\nThe highest benevolence acts it, but thereby does nothing,\nThe highest righteousness acts it, and acting has thereby,\nThe highest propriety acts it, and then, when none respond,\nIt stretches forth its arm, and enforces its reply.\nSo, when the Tao is lost to sight, its attributes are shown,\nWhen these are lost to sight, we find Benevolence appear,\nWhen Benevolence is lost to sight, then Righteousness comes on,\nAnd when Self-righteousness is lost, Propriety is here.\nNow, these propriety-things are

incomplete, and yet these very things\nAre taken for their titles by princes and by kings;\nSo it is sometimes that losing gains again,\nAnd sometimes that gaining loses in its turn.\nI am teaching what, by others taught, I learn;\nThe violent and aggressive a good death do not die,\nAnd the father of this teaching"it is I.'},{chapter:43,content:"The softest thing, (like water), in the world, will gallop o'er,\nAnd overcome the hardest, as we know,\nAnd what has non-existence will enter everywhere\nThough there be no crevices through which to go.\nBy this I know the benefit of non-assertiveness,\nThe profit when from acting we refrain,\nSilent teaching! passive doing! alas, there are but few\nUnder heaven this advantage to obtain!"},{chapter:44,content:"Which is nearer you,\nYour name or yourself?\nWhich is more to you,\nYour person or your pelf?\nAnd is your loss or gain\nThe more malicious elf?\nExtreme love's price\nMust be paid with sacrifice.\nHoarding to excess\nBrings ruin its its place,\nWho knows he has enough\nNever knows disgrace,\nWho knows when to stop\nDanger will efface,\nAnd long can endure,\nEvermore secure."},{chapter:45,content:"Who can behold his great work incomplete\nWill keep his usefulness without decay,\nHe who regards his fullness as a void\nIn usefulness can exercise each day.\nHis greatest straightness seems like crookedness,\nHis greatest skill seems like stupidity,\nHis greatest eloquence of voice and tongue\nThe stammering seems of imbecility.\nBy constant motion cold is overcome,\nBut heat by being still is conquered best,\nIn purity and clearness is the type\nOf all beneath the sky made manifest."},{chapter:46,content:"With the world in step with Tao horses work upon the farms,\nWhen the Tao is disregarded they respond to war's alarms,\nAnd are bred in border waste and wilderness;\nThere is no greater sin than to sanction fell desire,\nThan a discontented life no calamity more dire,\nNone greater than the grasping to possess;\nAnd he who knows contentment has the all-sufficient cure,\nAnd satisfied, will evermore endure."},{chapter:47,content:"Without going beyond his doorway\nOne may know all beneath the sky,\nWithout peeping out from his window\nSee the Tao of Heaven go by;\nAnd the farther he goes from home he finds\nThat knowledge becomes less nigh.\nSo the sages did not travel\nTo acquire a knowledge of things,\nThey named them aright without wasting\nTheir life in vain journeyings;\nAnd, striving not, accomplished ends\nBy the power which quietude brings."},{chapter:48,content:"Striving for learning one gains a daily addition,\nUsing the Tao there follows a daily remission,\nAnd as the work lessens and lessens there comes a condition\nOf nothing doing, when nothing is left to do.\nHe who would take as his own all the realm under heaven,\nAccomplishes it when no trouble is taken or given,\nIf trouble he use, by trouble itself he is

by force and circumstance;\nHence all things honor Tao that grow,\nAnd all exalt its vast outflow.\nThis exaltation of the Tao,\nThis honor where it operates,\nIs not obedience to command\nFrom that which fashions or creates,\nBut comes from all, whate'er they be,\nA tribute cast spontaneously.\nThe Tao produces everything,\nThe Teh, it nurses, raises, feeds,\nCompletes, matures, prolongs, and

Tao,\n'Tis only bold display that I should fear;\nFor plain and simple ways Great Tao suggest,\nBut people love cross-paths and by-ways best.\nThe halls and courts are splendid, but the fields\nUncultivated are, the granaries\nEmpty; to put on ornamented robes,\nAnd keen-edged swords, to gorge with gluttonies,\nTo pile up wealth; this, robbers'pride I call,\nBut, of a surety, not

are tender and the sinews weak,\nYet firmly grasp, the sexual\nUnconscious sleeps, and yet it still is there,\nA perfect spirit physical,\nWith throat unharmed he cries the whole day long,\nEach perfect part is linked with all.\nTo know this harmony is called eternal;\nTo know the eternal, this is called\nBrightness supernal.\nIncrease of life is blessedness, they say,\nThey call the heart-directed spirit strength,\nBut these things reach their fullest growth, at length,\nAnd plunge to swift decay;\nWe call all this contrary to the Tao,\nWhatever is contrary to the Tao\nSoon will pass away."},{chapter:56,content:"They who know speak not,\nAnd they who speak know not;\nTo close the mouth and shut the gates,\nTo blunt the point which lacerates,\nTo simplify what complicates;\nTo temper brightness in its glare,\nThe shadows of the dust to share,\nThe Deep's identity declare.\nA man like that cannot be got\nAnd loved, and then discarded be,\nCannot be got by profit's bribe,\nCannot be got for injury,\nCannot be got by 'honor's gift,\nNor got for cheap humility,\nAnd so becomes, throughout the world,\nThe type of high nobility."},{chapter:57,content:"Let the upright rule the state,\nAnd the craftful the army lead,\nBut the realm can only be made one's own\nWhen from active scheming freed.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy facts that are open to all,\nAs you multiply prohibitive laws\nThe people to poverty fall.\nYou increase disorder as well,\nWhen you increase the weapons of war,\nAnd the more and more artful and cunning men grow,\nThe more and more crafty contrivance they show,\nAnd the more laws and more thieves there are.\nSaid the sage, I do nothing, and men\nOf themselves transformed will be,\nI love to keep still, they have uprightness,\nI do no scheming, and wealth they possess,\nI have no ambition, and plain-mindedness\nWill come spontaneously."},{chapter:58,content:"With a government of liberality\nThe people all enjoy prosperity,\nWhen government has keen and prying eyes,\nThen poverty and misery arise.\nFor happiness, alas! but only hides\nThe place behind where misery abides,\nAnd misery ever leans on happiness;\nWho knows its end? or is it limitless?\nWhen uprightness in turn appears as strange,\nThen goodness, too, to strangeness soon will change,\nConfusion of mankind! its day of wrong!\nAssuredly it has continued long.\nTherefore, the sage is square, hut injures none,\nIs angular, but hurt has never done,\nIs strict, yet no restriction undertakes,\nAnd dazzles not while he illuminates."},{chapter:59,content:"In governing men or dealing with Heaven there is nothing like moderation,\nAnd moderation is what is called an early habituation,\nWhich, when acquired, heaps virtues up in vast accumulation.\nAnd then, with virtues thus heaped up in vast accumulation,\nTo the overcoming of everything there is no limitation,\nAnd when one knows no limits, he may even have the nation.\nPossessing the Mother of the State, he is thereby long-enduring,\nAs we say of a tree, its roots are deep, and its staunch stem reassuring,\nIn clearest sight to keep the Tao is lasting life securing."},{chapter:60,content:"Rule a great state in the way one would fry little fish,\nWithout gutting or scraping, consider the good of the whole,\nLet the empire be ruled in accord with the rule of the Tao\nAnd the spirits of those who are gone will not seek to control.\nNot only not seek, but spirits will harm not the people,\nNot only not harm, but, because of the mle of the sage,\nWho harms not, these twain, not seeking to injure each other,\nWill therefore in virtue together unite and engage."},{chapter:61,content:"A great state is like a great river,\nDownflowing with movement and life,\nOf all under heaven the union,\nOf all under heaven the wife.\nConsider the female, the woman\nOvercomes by her quietude wholly,\nSome make themselves lowly to conquer,\nSome conquer because they are lowly.\nAnd so a great state condescending\nWill win smaller states to unite,\nAnd small states, themselves by abasement\nWill conquer far more than by fight.\nIf the great state desire but to nourish,\nAnd the small to preserve and extend,\nThen each has secured what it sought for,\nBut to do this the great one must bend."},{chapter:62,content:"Tao is the hidden refuge of all things,\nTo the good man his richest treasure brings,\nAnd to the bad in guardianship it clings.\nIts beautiful words buy honor by their use,\nIts noble deeds lift people from abuse,\nAnd even the bad, are they from it cut loose?\nSo when the emperor, chosen to his throne,\nAppoints three great ones, by high titles known,\nIf one of these should come to him, alone,\nHolding the jade-screen, with four homes fleet,\nHe would be less than one on lowly seat\nWho could the lessons of the Tao repeat.\nWhy did the ancients prize this Tao so much?\nWas it not because it answered every touch,\nAnd that the sin-bound, even, escaped thereby?\nSo it is most prized of all beneath the sky."},{chapter:63,content:"Act the non-acting, let dealing go on without dealings,\nIn the tasteless find taste, let the great in the little be known,\nFind in the few that therein are embodied the many,\nAnd recompense hatred with deeds of goodness alone.\nConsider what may become difficult, while it is easy,\nManage the great, by taking it while it is small,\nFrom the easy arise all the difficult things under heaven,\nAnd affairs that are great their source in the little recall.\nSo the sage, not acting the great, the great will accomplish,\nWho promises lightly lacks truth, and they who believe\nMany things to be easy will find many hard, while the sage\nWith the difficult, even, finds nothing too hard to achieve."},{chapter:64,content:"That which is at rest is easy to be kept hold of,\nAnd what has made no sign, and is yet concealed from all,\nIs easy to be taken care of then by proper measures,\nBreak it while it is feeble, scatter it while it is small.\nAct before it exists, regulate before disorder,\nThe mighty tree that fills the arms has grown from a tiny sprout,\nFrom a little mound of earth was raised the tower of nine stories,\nAnd the journey of a thousand miles began with the first step out.\nHe that makes mars, he that grasps loses;\nThe sage will neither make, nor mar, nor grasp, and cannot lose,\nBut people fail in business, on the verge of its succeeding,\nBy losing at the end the care they first began to use.\nAnd so the sage does not desire the things desired by others,\nHe does not prize the treasures that are difficult to obtain,\nHe learns what others do not learn, he turns back to their leavings,\nAnd helps spontaneous nature, but dares not to constrain."},{chapter:65,content:"In centuries of old the men who used the light\nOf the Tao to its goodness were not blinded,\nThey used to practise it not to make the people bright,\nBut, better still, to make them simple-minded.\nIn the governing of men the very hardest thing\nTo encounter is their sapience redundant,\nTo govern by this sapience a robber rule will bring,\nAnd, to rule without it, blessing most abundant.\nWho knows of these two things has the key of government,\nThere is benefit profound in their rehearsal,\nFar-reaching in extent, from all else different,\nIt will swiftly bring agreement universal."},{chapter:66,content:"Rivers and seas!\nHomage and tribute from all the valley streams\nPour into these;\nThey lower themselves, and for this reason alone\nBecome royalties.\nSo the wise man,\nIf ever he wish to be above other men,\nIn his words will plan\nTo remain below, and if he desire to lead,\nWill keep from the van.\nAnd in this way\nThough he dwell above, men will not feel his weight,\nHe leads the array,\nBut they feel that he is not an impediment,\nNor in their way.\nAnd so his compeers\nUnwearyingly exalt and honor him\nWith joy and cheers,\nAnd since he does not strive, no strife with him\nEver appears."},{chapter:67,content:"All the world agrees\nThat while my Tao is great,\nMyself unseemly seems to be,\nLike one of low estate.\nBut because of his unseemliness\nNow only is he great,\nFor long has mediocrity\nHad seemliness for mate.\nThree precious things I hold,\nAnd guard with diligence,\nCompassionateness, economy,\nAnd avoiding precedence.\nWith the first I can be brave,\nWith the second generous be,\nAnd, while I shrink from precedence,\nHold honor's high degree.\nBut if they discard compassion,\nAnd are all for bravery,\nEconomy, and still are all\nFor generosity,\nIf they give up the rearmost place,\nAnd in front they strive to be,\n'Tis death! For compassionateness will give\nIn battle victory,\nAnd Heaven for sure defense will spread\nCompassion's canopy."},{chapter:68,content:"The great commander is not a warlike man,\nThe hardest fighter is not a man of wrath,\nThe greatest conqueror shares not in the strife,\nThe great employer treads the workmen's path.\nThis is the virtue known as 'striving not,'\nThe wondrous power of utilizing men,\nAnd this is called the fellowship with Heaven,\nThe fellowship the ancients followed then."},{chapter:69,content:"An experienced soldier said, 'I dare not be\nThe host in war, I'd rather be the guest;\nI dare not, at the first, advance an inch,\nBut rather would retire a foot if pressed.'\nIt is to march when there's nowhere to march,\nTo threat with arms when there are arms nowhere,\nTo charge without an enemy in sight,\nTo take by sword and spear when none are there.\nMisfortune never greater can there be\nThan to make light of enemies in war,\nThereby we lose our all, for then when meet\nEmbattled hosts, the weak is conqueror."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are most easily known,\nMost easy'to practise, too,\nBut none in the world my words can know,\nAnd their practice can pursue.\nThere's an Ancestry in my words,\nThere's a Head for the things I preach,\nBut, because they are all misunderstood,\nThey know not what I teach.\nThe ones who know me are few,\nBut the few who know me prize,\nThough the sage may wear a hair-cloth garb,\nThe gem in his bosom lies."},{chapter:71,content:"To know the not-known, this is something high,\nAnd not to know the known is sick to be,\nTo be sick of sickness sickness will dispel,\nTo be sick of ignorance will make us well,\nThereby, the sage from ignorance is free."},{chapter:72,content:"When people to the dreadful give no heed,\nOn them will come what is their greatest dread;\nThen narrow not the dwelling place they need,\nDo not depreciate the life they lead,\nFor from dislike of things dislike is bred.\nTherefore the one who knows himself, the sage,\nOf what he is himself makes no display,\nHe loves himself, indeed, from youth to age,\nBut self-esteem does not his mind engage,\nHe chooses that and this he puts away."},{chapter:73,content:"Whose courage makes him dare is slain,\nHe lives whom courage makes refrain,\nAnd harm or profit each will gain;\nBut Heaven's hate, what could compel\nThat it on this or that one fell,\n'Tis even hard for sage to tell.\nNot to strive is Heaven's way,\nAnd yet it conquers; naught to say,\nYet answers; will uncalled obey;\nIts perfect plans in slowness hide,\nThe net of Heaven has meshes wide,\nBut through its meshes none can glide."},{chapter:74,content:"When people fear not death, then why\nAffright them with its fear?\nIf kept in awe of it could I\nSeize one for some wild deed to die,\nAnd slay him?

its uses it is inexhaustible."},{chapter:36,content:"When Nature is about to withhold a thing it is sure first to increase it.\nWhen about to weaken it is first sure to strengthen.\nWhen about to debase it is certain first to exalt.\nWhen about to deprive it is first sure to give.\nThis is what I call the covert agreement.\nThe soft and the weak overcome the hard and the strong.\nAs a fish out of water is in danger, so a nation is in peril when its armaments are revealed to the people."},{chapter:37,content:"Tao remains quiescent, and yet leaves nothing undone.\nIf a ruler or a king could hold it, all things would of their own accord assume the desired shape.\nIf in the process of transformation desire should arise, I would check it by the ineffable simplicity.\nThe ineffable simplicity would bring about an absence of desire, and rest would come back again.\nThus the world would regenerate itself."},{chapter:38,content:"The superior virtue is not recognized as such, and it is therefore the very essence of virtue.\nThe inferior virtue has the distinction of virtue, therefore it lacks the essence.\nThe superior virtue is spontaneous, and makes no claim to merit.\nThe inferior virtue is designing, and lays claim to recognition.\nThe higher benevolence acts without pretension to merit.\nThe inferior justice acts, and also makes pretensions.\nThe inferior expediency is designing, and therefore no one honours it.\nTherefore does it bare its arm and assert itself by force.\nThus it transpires that when virtue is lost, benevolence takes its place.\nWhen benevolence is lost, justice ensues.\nWhen justice is lost, then expediency follows.\nBut expediency is the mere shadow of what is right and true, and it is portentous of confusion.\nSuperficial virtue is the

rejects the one, and takes the other with both hands."},{chapter:39,content:'Certain things have, by unity, lasted from most ancient times, namely:-\nThe transparency of Heaven;\nThe steadfastness of Earth;\nThe incorporeality of spirits;\nThe watery plenitude of valleys;\nThe life of all creations;\nThe government of kings and princes;\nAll these endure by unity.\nBut for the cause of its transparency Heaven would be in danger of obscuration.\nBut for the cause of its steadfastness the Earth would be in danger of disintegration.\nBut for the cause of their incorporeality spirits would be in danger of decease.\nBut for the cause of their plenitude the valleys would be in danger of sterility.\nBut for the cause of their vitality all creation would be in danger of destruction.\nBut for the cause of their honour and greatness princes and kings would be in danger of an overthrow.\nHerein we see how honour is derived from that which is without distinction; and how greatness rests upon, and is sustained by, that which is insignificant.\nHence do princes and kings call themselves ""orphans,"" ""solitary men,"" and ""chariots without wheels.""\nDo they not thereby acknowledge their authority to be vested in, and supported by, their superiors?\nWho can deny it?\nSurely ""a chariot without wheels"" is no chariot at all!\nIt is as hard for a man to be isolated like a single gem as to be lost in the crowd like a common pebble.'},{chapter:40,content:"The path of the Tao is backward.\nThe characteristic of Tao is gentleness.\nEverything in the universe comes from existence, and existence from non-existence."},{chapter:41,content:"When a wise man hears the Tao, he follows it.\nWhen one of average mind hears it, he holds to it a while and presently loses it.\nWhen a foolish man hears it, he only laughs at it.\nIf it were not held in derision by such men, it could not rightly be called Tao.\nTherefore, as the verse-makers would say:-\nWho shines with Tao is lost in shade;\nHis path in Tao is retrograde,\nAnd all his actions are obscure.\nThe highest virtue has no name,\nThe greatest pureness seems but shame;\nTrue wisdom seems the least secure.\nInherent goodness seems most strange;\nWhat most endures is changeless Change;\nAnd squareness doth no angles make.\nThe largest vessel none can gird; The loudest voice was never heard;\nThe greatest thing no form doth take.\nFor Tao is hidden, and it has no name; but it is good at beginning and finishing."},{chapter:42,content:"Tao emaned the One; the one emaned the Two; and the two emaned the Three.\nFrom the Three all things have proceeded.\nAll things are backed by the Unmanifest and faced by the Manifest.\nThat which unites them is the immaterial breath.\nOrphanage, isolation, and a chariot without wheels are shunned by the people; but kings and great men appropriate these names to themselves.\nFor things increase by being deprived; and being added to they are diminished.\nThat which people teach by their actions I make use of to instruct them.\nThose who are violent and headstrong, for example, do not die a natural death.\nThey teach a good lesson, and so I make use of them."},{chapter:43,content:"The gentlest thing in the world will override the strongest.\nThe Non-Existent pervades everything, though there be no inlet.\nBy this I comprehend how effectual is

ruined.\nHe who stands still will never meet danger.\nThese are the people who endure."},{chapter:45,content:"He who sees that his highest attainments are always incomplete may go on working indefinitely.\nHe who sees his greatest possessions to be inadequate may go on acquiring forever.\nHis highest rectitude is but crookedness.\nHis greatest wisdom is but foolishness.\nHis sweetest eloquence is but stammering.\nAction overcomes cold; inaction overcomes heat.\nWith virtue and quietness one may conquer the world."},{chapter:46,content:"When Tao is in the world, horses are used in the pastureland.\nWhen Tao has left the world, chargers are reared in the wilderness.\nThere is no greater sin than indulging desire.\nThere is no greater pain than discontent.\nThere is nothing more disastrous than the greed of gain.\nHence the satisfaction of contentment is an everlasting competence."},{chapter:47,content:"A man may know the world without leaving his own home.\nThrough his windows he can see the supreme Tao.\nThe further afield he goes the less likely is he to find it.\nTherefore the wise man knows without travelling, names things without seeing them, and accomplishes everything without action."},{chapter:48,content:"Bodily and mental distress is increased every day in the effort to get knowledge.\nBut this distress is daily diminished by the getting of Tao.\nDo you continually curtail your effort till there be nothing left of it?\nBy non-action there is nothing which cannot be effected.\nA man might, without the least distress, undertake the government of the world.\nBut those who distress themselves about governing the world are not fit for it."},{chapter:49,content:"The wise man has no fixed opinions to call his own.\nHe accommodates himself to the minds of others.\nI would return good for good; I would also return evil for evil.\nVirtue is good.\nI would meet trust with trust; I would likewise meet suspicion with confidence.\nVirtue is trustful.\nThe wise man lives in the world with modest restraint, and his heart goes out in sympathy to all men.\nTHe people give him their confidence, and he regards them all as his

into Death. And wherefore?\nBecause men strive only after the Sensuous Life.\nIt has been said that one who knows how to safeguard Life can go through the country without protection against the rhinoceros and tiger.\nHe may enter into battle without fear of the sword.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place wherein to drive his horn.\nThe tiger finds no place wherein to fix his claws.\nThe sword finds no place wherein to thrust itself.\nWhy is this?\nIt is because he has overcome Death."},{chapter:51,content:"Tao brings forth and Teh nourishes.\nAll things take up their several forms, and natural forces bring them to perfection.\nTherefore all things conspire to exalt Tao and to cherish virtue.\nBut this regard of Tao and Teh is not in deference to any mandate.\nIt is unconstrained, and therefore it endures forever.\nFor Tao produces all things, and Teh nourishes, increases, feeds, matures, protects, and watches over them.\nTo produce without possessing; to work without expecting; top enlarge without usurping; this is the absolute virtue!"},{chapter:52,content:"That from which the universe sprang may be looked upon as its Mother.\nBy knowing the Mother you have access to the child.\nAnd if, knowing the child, you prefer the Mother, though your body perish, yet you will come to no harm.\nKeep your mouth shut, and close up the doors of sight and sound, and as long as you live you will have no vexation.\nBut open your mouth, or become inquisitive, and you will be in trouble all your life long.\nTo perceive things in the germ is intelligence.\nTo remain gentle is to be invincible.\nFollow the light that guides you homeward, and do not get lost in the darkness.\nThis I call using the eternal."},{chapter:53,content:"Ah that I were wise enough to follow the great Tao!\nAdministration is a great undertaking.\nThe great Tao is extremely simple, but the people prefer the complex ways.\nWhile the palace is extremely well appointed, the fields may be full of tares, and the granaries may be empty.\nTo dress grandly, to carry sharp swords, to eat and drink excessively, and to amass great wealth, this I call stylish theft.\nThat it is not Tao is certain."},{chapter:54,content:"He who plants rightly never uproots.\nHe who lays hold rightly never relinquishes.\nHis posterity will honour him continually.\nWhoever develops the Tao in himself will be rooted in virtue.\nWhoever develops the Tao in his family will cause his virtue to spread.\nWhoever develops the Tao in his village will increase prosperity.\nWhoever develops the Tao in the kingdom will make good fortune prevail.\nWhoever develops Tao in the world will make virtue universal.\nI observe myself, and so I come to know others.\nI observe my family, and all others grow familiar.\nI study this world, and others come within my knowledge.\nHow else should I come to know the laws which govern all things, save thus, that I observe them in myself?"},{chapter:55,content:"The man who is saturated with Virtue is like a little child.\nScorpions will not sting him, wild beasts will not seize him, nor will birds of prey pluck at him.\nHis young bones are not hard, neither are his sinews strong, yet his grasp is firm and sure.\nHe is full of vitality, though unconscious of his sex.\nThough he should cry out all day, yet he is never hoarse.\nHerein is shown his harmony with Nature.\nThe knowledge of this harmony is the eternal Tao.\nThe knowledge of the eternal Tao is illumination.\nHabits of excess grow upon a man, and the mind, giving way to the passions, they increase day by day.\nAnd when the passions have reached their climax, they fall.\nThis is against the nature of Tao.\nAnd what is contrary to Tao soon comes to an end."},{chapter:56,content:"He who knows the Tao does not discuss it, and those who babble about it do not know it.\nTo keep the lips closed, to shut the doors of sight and sound, to smooth off the corners, to temper the glare, and to be on a level with the dust of the earth, this is the mysterious virtue.\nWhoever observes this will regard alike both frankness and reserve, kindness and injury, honour and degradation.\nFor this reason he will be held in great esteem of all men."},{chapter:57,content:"The righteous man may rule the nation.\nThe strategic man may rule the army.\nBut the man who refrains from active measures should be the king.\nHow do I know this:-\nWhen the actions of the people are controlled by prohibited laws, the country becomes more and more impoverished.\nWhen the people are allowed the free use of arms, the Government is in danger.\nThe more crafty and dexterous the people become, the more do artificial things come into use.\nAnd when those cunning arts are publicly esteemed, then do rogues prosper.\nTherefore the wise man says:-\nI will design nothing: and the people will shape themselves.\nI will keep quiet; and the people will find their rest.\nI will not assert myself; and the people will come forth.\nI will discountenance ambition; and the people will revert to their natural simplicity."},{chapter:58,content:"A free and generous government gives the people a chance to develop.\nWhen a government is rigid and exacting the people are cramped and miserable.\nMisery is but the shadow of happiness.\nHappiness is but the cloak of misery.\nWhen will there be an end to them?\nIf we dispense with rectitude, distortion will assert itself; and what was good in its way will give place to what is evil.\nVerily the people have been under a cloud for a long time.\nTherefore the wise man is full of rectitude, but he does not chirp and carve at others.\nHe is just, but he does not admonish others.\nHe is upright, but he does not straighten others.\nHe is enlightened, but he does not offend with his brightness."},{chapter:59,content:"In ruling men and in serving Heaven there is nothing like moderation.\nBy means of it one attains to his first estate.\nWhen this is attained a man is possessed of an indefinite store of virtue.\nWith such a store of virtue he will overcome everything.\nAnd of this mastery there will be no limit.\nThus, without hindrance, he may possess the Kingdom.\nSuch a man has the mother-constitution, and will endure indefinitely.\nHe is like the plant whose roots are deep and whose stem is firm.\nThus may a man live long and see many days."},{chapter:60,content:"The state should be governed as we cook small fish, without much business.\nBringing the Tao to the governing of the Kingdom will give rest to the shades of the dead.\nNot that the Spirits will be inactive, but they will cease to trouble the people.\nBut what is of more importance, the wise ruler of the people will not hurt them.\nAnd in so far as they do not interfere with one another, their influences conspire to the general good!"},{chapter:61,content:"The kingdom, like a river, becomes great by being lowly; it is thereby the centre to which all the world tends.\nIt is similar in the case of woman:\nShe conquers man by continual quietness.\nAnd quietness is the same as submission.\nTherefore a great state, by condescension to those beneath it, may gain the government of them.\nLikewise a small state, by submission to one that is greater, may secure its alliance.\nThus the one gains adherence, and the other obtains favours.\nAlthough the great state desires to annex and to nourish others, yet the small state desires to be allied to and serve the greater.\nThus both will be satisfied, if only the greater will condescend."},{chapter:62,content:"Tao is the secret guardian of all things.\nIt enriches the good man and forfends the evildoer.\nIts counsel is always in season; its benevolence is always in demand.\nEven those who are not good it does not forsake.\nTherefore, when the Emperor takes his throne and appoints his nobles, he who comes before him bearing the insignia of a prince and escorted by a mounted retinue is not to be compared with one who humbly presents this Tao.\nFor why did the ancients hold it in such esteem?\nWas it not because it could be had without much seeking, and because by means of it man might escape from sin?\nFor this it was esteemed the greatest thing in the world."},{chapter:63,content:"Acting without design, occupying oneself without making a business of it, finding the great in what is the small, and the many in the few, repaying injury with kindness, effecting difficult things while they are easy, and managing great things in their beginnings, is the method of Tao.\nAll difficult things have their origin in that which is easy, and the great things in that which is small.\nTherefore the wise man can accomplish great things without even attempting them.\nHe who lightly assents will seldom keep his word.\nHe who accounts all things easy will have many difficulties.\nTherefore the Sage takes great account of small things, and so never has any difficulty."},{chapter:64,content:"What is small is easily held.\nWhat is expected is easily provided for.\nWhat is brittle is easily broken.\nWhat is small is soon dispersed.\nTransact your business before it takes shape.\nRegulate things before confusion begins.\nThe tree which fills the arms grew from a tender shoot.\nThe castle of nine storeys was raised on a heap of earth.\nThe journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\nWhoever designs only destroys.\nWhoever grasps, loses.\nThe Sage does not act thus, therefore he does no harm.\nHe does not grasp, and therefore he never loses.\nBut the common people, in their undertakings, fail on the eve of success.\nIf they were as prudent at the end as they are at the beginning, there would be no such failures.\nTherefore the Sage is only ambitious of what others despise, and sets no value on things difficult to obtain.\nHe acquires no common learning, but returns to that which people have passed by.\nThus he aims at simple development in all things, and acts without design."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancients who practiced the Tao did not make use of it to render the people brilliant, but to make them simple and natural.\nThe difficulty in governing the people is through overmuch policy.\nHe who tries to govern the kingdom by policy is only a scourge to it; while he who governs without it is a blessing.\nTo know these two things is the perfect knowledge of government, and to keep them continually in view is called the virtue of simplicity.\nDeep and wide is this simple virtue;

that is the cause of their superiority.\nThus the Sage, wishing to govern the people, speaks of himself as beneath them; and wishing to lead them, places himself behind them.\nSo, while he is yet above them, they do not feel his weight; and being before them, he yet causes no obstruction.\nTherefore all men exalt him with acclamation, and none is offended.\nAnd because he does not strive, no man is his enemy."},{chapter:67,content:"All the world avows that while my Taoism is great, it is yet incompetent!\nIt is its greatness which makes it appear incompetent.\nIf it were like others, it would long ago have been recognized as incompetent.\nBut I hold fast to three precious things, which I also cherish.\nThe first is gentleness.\nThe second is economy.\nThe third is humility.\nWith such gentleness I can be daring.\nWith such economy I can be generous.\nWith such humility I can be great in service, as a vessel of honour.\nBut in these days men forsake gentleness and become only obtrusive.\nThey abandon economy and become only excessive.\nThey relinquish humility and strive for precedence, and thus for death.\nGentleness is ever victorious in attack and secure in defence.\nTherefore when Heaven would preserve a man it enfolds him with gentleness."},{chapter:68,content:"The good commander is not imperious.\nThe good fighter is not wrathful.\nThe greatest conqueror does not wage war.\nThe best master governs by condescension.\nThis is the virtue of not contending.\nThis is the virtue of persuasion.\nThis is the imitation of Heaven, and this was the highest aim of the ancients."},{chapter:69,content:'A great warrior has said, ""I dare not be the host, I would rather be the guest; I dare not advance an inch, I would rather retire a foot.""\nNow this I call filling in without marshalling the ranks; baring the arms without preparing to fight; grasping the sword without unsheathing it;

the one is injurious and the other of advantage.\nBut who is to say why one of them should incur the judgement of Heaven?\nThat is why the Sage finds it difficult to act.\nThe celestial Tao does not strive, and yet overcomes everything.\nIt does not speak, yet is skilful in replying.\nIt does not call, yet things come to it readily.\nIt is quiet in its methods, yet its plans are thoroughly effective.\nThe net of Heaven has large meshes, and yet nothing escapes it!"},{chapter:74,content:"When the people do not fear death, of what use is it to overawe them with it as a penalty?\nAnd if they were always held in fear of death, and I could lay my hand upon all evil doers and slay them, would I dare to do it?\nThere is always the Great Executioner!\nFor one to usurp that office is like a novice cutting out the work of a great architect.\nSuch a one rarely fails to cut his own hands!"},{chapter:75,content:"The people suffer from famine on account of the heavy taxation put upon them.\nThis is the cause of their need.\nThe people are difficult to govern because of the overbearing of their superiors.\nThis is the cause of their trouble.\nThe people make light of dying because of the great hardships of trying to live.\nThis is the reason for their indifference to death.\nTherefore to keep living in obscurity is better than making overmuch of it."},{chapter:76,content:"Man at his birth is supple and tender, but in death he is rigid and strong.\nIt is the same with everything.\nTrees and plants in their early growth are pliant and soft, but at the end they are withered and tough.\nThus rigidity and strength are concomitants of death, but softness and gentleness are companions of life.\nTherefore the warrior who relies on his strength cannot conquer death, while the powerful tree becomes a mere timber support.\nFor the place of the strong and the firm is below, while that of the gentle and yielding is above.\n"},{chapter:77,content:"Like the bending of an archer's bow is the Tao of Heaven!\nIt brings down that which is high, and raises up that which is depressed.\nIt takes away where there is excess, and gives where there is deficiency.\nThe Tao of Heaven makes all things equal.\nThis Tao is not of man.\nMan takes from the needy to add to his own excess.\nWho is he that, having a superabundance, can bring it to the service of the world?\nOnly he who has the Tao.\nThis is why the wise man acts without expectation of reward, and completes his task without claiming merit.\nFor thus he hides his wealth."},{chapter:78,content:"Nothing on earth is so weak and yielding as water, but for breaking down the firm and strong it has no equal.\nThis admits of no alternative.\nAll the world knows that the soft can wear away the hard, and the weak can conquer the strong, but none can carry it out in practice.\nTherefore the Sage says: He who bears the reproach of his country is really the lord of the land.

A good fastener needs no cords or knots, And yet it is impossible to untie after him.\nEven if men be bad, why should they be rejected? Therefore the Sage is always a good saviour of men, And no man is rejected; He is a good saviour of things, And nothing is rejected: This is called double enlightenment.\nTherefore good men are had men's instructors, And bad men are good men's materials.\nThose who do not esteem their instructors, And those who do not love their materials, Though expedient, are in fact greatly confused.

Then, though they had boats and carts, they would have no use for them; though they had armour and weapons they would not display them. They should be taught to return to the use of the quippo; to be content with their food, their clothing, their dwellings, and to be happy in their traditions. Though neighbouring states were within sight, and the people should hear the barking of their dogs and the crowing of their cocks, they would grow old and die without visiting them."},{chapter:81,content:"Sincere words are not (necessarily) pleasant, nor are pleasant words (necessarily) sincere.\nThe good are not (necessarily) skillful debaters, not are skillful debaters (necessarily) good men.\nThe wise are not (necessarily) well informed, nor are the well informed (necessarily) wise.\nThe Holy Man does not accumulate.

It is obvious that if goodness makes a display of goodness, it is sheer badness.

And why can heaven and earth endure and be lasting? Because they do not live for themselves.

The water's goodness benefiteth the ten thousand things, yet it quarreleth not.\nWater dwelleth in the places which the multitudes of men shun; therefore it is near unto the eternal Reason\nThe dwelling of goodness is in lowliness.

Before heaven and earth, it was. How calm it is! How spiritual!\nAlone it standeth, and it changeth not; around it moveth, and it suffereth not; yet therefore can it be the world's mother.\nIts name I know not, but its nature I call Reason.\nConstrained to give a name, I call it the great.

The earth's standard is heaven. Heaven's standard is Reason. Reason's standard is intrinsic."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is of the light the root, and rest is motion's master.\nTherefore the holy man in his daily walk does not depart from gravity. Although he may have magnificent sights, he calmly sits with liberated mind.\nBut how is it when the master of the ten thousand chariots in his personal conduct is too light for the empire? If he is too light he will lose his vassals. If he is too passionate he will lose the throne."},{chapter:27,content:"'Good travelers leave no trace nor track,\nGood speakers, in logic show no lack,\nGood counters need no counting rack.\n'Good lockers bolting bars need not,\nYet none their locks can loose.\nGood binders need no string nor knot,\nYet none unties their noose.'\nTherefore the holy man is always a good saviour of men, for there are no outcast people. He is always a good saviour of things, for there are no outcast things. This is called applied enlightenment.\nThus the good man does not respect multitudes of men. The bad man respects the people's wealth. Who does not esteem multitudes nor is charmed by their wealth, though his knowledge be greatly confused, he must be recognized as profoundly spiritual"},{chapter:28,content:"'Who his manhood shows\nAnd his womanhood knows\nBecomes the empire's river.\nIs he the empire's river,\nHe will from virtue never deviate,\nAnd home he turneth to a child's estate.\n'Who his brightness shows\nAnd his blackness knows\nBecomes the empire's model.\nIs he the empire's model,\nOf virtue ne'er shall he be destitute,\nAnd home he turneth to the absolute.\n'Who knows his fame\nAnd guards his shame\nBecomes the empire's valley.\nIs he the empire's valley,\nFor e'er his virtue will sufficient be,\nAnd home he turneth to simplicity.'\nSimplicity, when scattered, becomes a vessel of usefulness. The holy man, by using it, becomes the chief leader; and truly, a great principle will never do harm."},{chapter:29,content:"When one desires to take in hand the empire and make it, I see him not succeed. The empire is a divine vessel which cannot be made. One who makes it, mars it. One who takes it, loses it.\nAnd it is said of beings:\n'Some are obsequious, others move boldly,\nSome breathe warmly, others coldly,\nSome are strong and others weak,\nSome rise proudly, others sneak.'\nTherefore the holy man abandons excess, he abandons extravagance, he abandons indulgence."},{chapter:30,content:"He who with Reason assists the master of mankind will not with arms strengthen the empire.

Therefore he who has Reason does not rely on them.\nThe superior man when residing at home honors the left. When using arms, he honors the right.\nArms are unblest among tools and not the superior man's tools. Only when it is unavoidable he uses them.

He who enjoys the slaughter of men will most assuredly not obtain his will in the empire."},{chapter:32,content:"Reason, in its eternal aspect, is unnamable.\nAlthough its simplicity seems insignificant, the whole world does not dare to suppress it. If princes and kings could keep it, the ten thousand things would of themselves pay homage. Heaven and earth would unite in dripping sweet dew, and the people with no one to command them would of themselves be righteous.\nAs soon as Reason creates order, it becomes namable. Whenever the namable in its turn acquires existence, one learns to know when to stop.

It can be on the left and it can be on the right.\nThe ten thousand things depend upon it for their life, and it refuses them not. When its merit is accomplished it assumes not the name. Lovingly it nourishes the ten thousand things and plays not the lord. Ever desireless it can be classed with the small. The ten thousand things return home to it. It plays not the lord.

Therefore the sage keeps his mouth shut and his sense-gates closed.\n'He will blunt his own sharpness, His own tangles adjust; He will dim his own radiance, And be one with his dust.'\nThis is called profound identification.\nThus he is inaccessible to love and also inaccessible to enmity. He is inaccessible to profit and inaccessible to loss. He is also inaccessible to favor and inaccessible to disgrace. Thus he becomes world-honored."},{chapter:57,content:"With rectitude one governs the state; with craftiness one leads the army; with non-diplomacy one takes the empire. How do I know that it is so? Through IT.\nThe more restrictions and prohibitions are in the empire, the poorer grow the people. The more weapons the people have, the more troubled is the state. The more there is cunning and skill, the more startling events will happen. The more mandates and laws are enacted, the more there will be thieves and robbers.\nTherefore the holy man says: I practise non-assertion, and the people of themselves reform. I love quietude, and the people of themselves become righteous. I use no diplomacy, and the people of themselves become rich. I have no desire, and the people of themselves remain simple."},{chapter:58,content:"Whose government is unostentatious, quite unostentatious, his people will be prosperous, quite prosperous. Whose government is prying, quite prying, his people will be needy, quite needy.\nMisery, alas! rests upon happiness. Happiness, alas! underlies misery. But who foresees the catastrophe? It will not be prevented!\nWhat is ordinary becomes again extraordinary. What is good becomes again unpropitious. This bewilders people, and it happens constantly since times immemorial.\nTherefore the holy man is square but not sharp, strict but not obnoxious, upright but not restraining, bright but not dazzling."},{chapter:59,content:"To govern the people is the affair of heaven and there is nothing like thrift.\nNow consider that thrift is said to come from early practice.\nBy early practice it is said that we can accumulate an abundance of virtue. If one accumulates an abundance of virtue then there is nothing that can not be overcome.\nWhen nothing can not be overcome then no one knows his limit. When no one knows his limit one can have possession of the commonwealth.\nWho has possession of the commonwealth's mother [thrift] may last and abide.\nThis is called the possession of deep roots and of a staunch stem. To life, to everlastingness, to comprehension, this is the way."},{chapter:60,content:"Govern a great country as you would fry small fish: [neither gut nor scale them.]\nIf with Reason the empire is managed, its ghosts will not spook. Not only will its ghosts not spook, but its gods will not harm the people. Not only will its gods not harm the people, but neither will its holy men harm the people. Since neither will do harm, therefore their virtues will be combined."},{chapter:61,content:"A great state, one that lowly flows, becomes the empire's union, and the empire's wife.\nThe wife always through quietude conquers her husband, and by quietude renders herself lowly.\nThus a great state through lowliness toward small states will conquer the small states, and small states through lowliness toward great states will conquer great states.\nTherefore some render themselves lowly for the purpose of conquering; others are lowly and therefore conquer.\nA great state desires no more than to unite and feed the people; a small state desires no more than to devote itself to the service of the people; but that both may obtain their wishes, the greater one must stoop."},{chapter:62,content:"The man of Reason is the ten thousand creatures' refuge, the good man's wealth, the bad man's stay.\nWith beautiful words one can sell. With honest conduct one can do still more with the people.\nIf a man be bad, why should he be thrown away? Therefore, an emperor was elected and three ministers appointed; but better than holding before one's face the jade table [of the ministry] and riding with four horses, is sitting still and propounding the eternal Reason.\nWhy do the ancients prize this Reason? Is it not, say, because when sought it is obtained and the sinner thereby can be saved? Therefore it is world-honored."},{chapter:63,content:"Assert non-assertion.\nPractise non-practice.\nTaste the tasteless.\nMake great the small.\nMake much the little.\nRequite hatred with virtue.\nContemplate a difficulty when it is easy. Manage a great thing when it is small.\nThe world's most difficult undertakings necessarily originate while easy, and the world's greatest undertakings necessarily originate while small.\nTherefore the holy man to the end does not venture to play the great, and thus he can accomplish his greatness.\nRash promises surely lack faith, and many easy things surely involve in many difficulties.\nTherefore, the holy man regards everything as difficult, and thus to the end encounters no difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"What is still at rest is easily kept quiet. What has not as yet appeared is easily prevented. What is still feeble is easily broken. What is still scant is easily dispersed.\nTreat things before they exist. Regulate things before disorder begins. The stout tree has originated from a tiny rootlet. A tower of nine stories is raised by heaping up [bricks of] clay. A thousand miles' journey begins with a foot.\nHe that makes mars. He that grasps loses.\nThe holy man does not make; therefore he mars not. He does not grasp; therefore he loses not. The people when undertaking an enterprise are always near completion, and yet they fail.\nRemain careful to the end as in the beginning and you will not fail in your enterprise.\nTherefore the holy man desires to be desireless, and does not prize articles difficult to obtain. He learns, not to be learned, and seeks a home where multitudes of people pass by.\nHe assists the ten thousand things in their natural development, but he does not venture to interfere."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancients who were well versed in Reason did not thereby enlighten the people; they intended thereby to make them simple-hearted.\nIf people are difficult to govern, it is because they are too smart. To govern the country with smartness is the country's curse. To govern the country without smartness is the country's blessing. He who knows these two things is also a model [like the ancients]. Always to know the model is called profound virtue.\nSpiritual virtue, verily, is profound. Verily, it is far-reaching. Verily, it is to everything reverse. But then it will procure great recognition."},{chapter:66,content:"That rivers and oceans can of the hundred valleys be kings is due to their excelling in lowliness. Thus they can of the hundred valleys be the kings.\nTherefore the holy man, when anxious to be above the people, must in his words keep underneath them. When anxious to lead the people, he must with his person keep behind them.\nTherefore the holy man dwells above, but the people are not burdened. He is ahead, but the people suffer no harm.\nTherefore the world rejoices in exalting him and does not tire. Because he strives not, no one in the world will strive with him."},{chapter:67,content:"All in the world call me great; but I resemble the unlikely. Now a man is great only because he resembles the unlikely. Did he resemble the likely, how lasting, indeed, would his mediocrity be!\nI have three treasures which I cherish and prize. The first is called compassion. The second is called economy. The third is called not daring to come to the front in the world.\nThe compassionate can be brave; the economical can be generous; those who dare not come to the front in the world can become perfect as chief vessels.\nNow, if people discard compassion and are brave; if they discard economy and are generous; if they discard modesty and are ambitious, they will surely die.\nNow, the compassionate will in attack be victorious, and in defence firm. Heaven when about to save one will with compassion protect him."},{chapter:68,content:"He who excels as a warrior is not warlike. He who excels as a fighter is not wrathful. He who excels in conquering the enemy does not strive. He who excels in employing men is lowly.\nThis is called the virtue of not-striving. This is called utilizing men's ability. This is called complying with heaven-since olden times the highest."},{chapter:69,content:"A military expert used to say: 'I dare not act as host [who takes the initiative] but act as guest [with reserve]. I dare not advance an inch, but I withdraw a foot.'\nThis is called marching without marching, threatening without arms, charging without hostility, seizing without weapons.\nNo greater misfortune than making light of the enemy! When we make light of the enemy, it is almost as though we had lost our treasure--[compassion].\nThus, if matched armies encounter one another, the one who does so in sorrow is sure to conquer."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practise, but in the world no one can understand, no one can practise them.\nWords have an ancestor; Deeds have a master [viz., Reason]. Since he is not understood, therefore I am not understood. Those who understand me are few, and thus I am distinguished.\nTherefore the holy man wears wool, and hides in his bosom his jewels."},{chapter:71,content:"To know the unknowable, that is elevating. Not to know the knowable, that is sickness.\nOnly by becoming sick of sickness can we be without sickness.\nThe holy man is not sick. Because he is sick of sickness, therefore he is not sick."},{chapter:72,content:"If the people do not fear the dreadful, the great dreadful will come, surely.\nLet them not deem their lives narrow. Let them not deem their lot wearisome. When it is not deemed wearisome, then it will not be wearisome.\nTherefore the holy man knows himself but does not display himself. He holds himself dear but does not honor himself. Thus he discards the latter and chooses the former."},{chapter:73,content:"Courage, if carried to daring, leads to death; courage, if not carried to daring, leads to life. Either of these two things is sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful.\n'Why \u2019t is by heaven rejected,\nWho has the reason detected?'\nTherefore the holy man also regards it as difficult.\nThe Heavenly Reason strives not, but it is sure to conquer. It speaks not, but it is sure to respond. It summons not, but it comes of itself. It works patiently, but is sure in its designs.\nHeaven's net is vast, so vast. It is wide-meshed, but it loses nothing."},{chapter:74,content:"If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by death? If we make people fear death, and supposing some would [still] venture to rebel, if we seize them for capital punishment, who will dare?\nThere is always an executioner who kills. Now to take the place of the executioner who kills is taking the place of the great carpenter who hews. If a man takes the place of the great carpenter who hews, he will rarely, indeed, fail to injure his hand."},{chapter:75,content:"The people hunger because their superiors consume too many taxes; therefore they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors are too meddlesome; therefore they are difficult to govern. The people make light of death on account of the intensity of their clinging to life; therefore they make light of death.\nHe who is not bent on life is worthier than he who esteems life."},{chapter:76,content:"Man during life is tender and delicate. When he dies he is stiff and stark.\nThe ten thousand things, the grass as well as the trees, while they live are tender and supple. When they die they are rigid and dry.\nThus the hard and the strong are the companions of death. The tender and the delicate are the companions of life.\nTherefore he who in arms is strong will not conquer.\nWhen a tree has grown strong it is doomed.\nThe strong and the great stay below. The tender and the delicate stay above."},{chapter:77,content:"Is not Heaven's Reason truly like stretching a bow? The high it brings down, the lowly it lifts up. Those who have abundance it depleteth; those who are deficient it augmenteth.\nSuch is Heaven's Reason. It depleteth those who have abundance but completeth the deficient.\nMan's Reason is not so. He depleteth the deficient in order to serve those who have abundance.\nWhere is he who would have abundance for serving the world?\nIndeed, it is the holy man who acts but claims not; merit he acquires but he does not dwell upon it, and does he ever show any anxiety to display his excellence?"},{chapter:78,content:"In the world nothing is tenderer and more delicate than water. In attacking the hard and the strong nothing will surpass it. There is nothing that herein takes its place.\nThe weak conquer the strong, the tender conquer the rigid. In the world there is no one who does not know it, but no one will practise it.\nTherefore the holy man says:\n'Him who the country's sin makes his,\nWe hail as priest at the great sacrifice.\nHim who the curse bears of the country's failing.\nAs king of the empire we are hailing.'\nTrue words seem paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When a great hatred is reconciled, naturally some hatred will remain. How can this be made good?\nTherefore the sage keeps the obligations of his contract and exacts not from others. Those who have virtue attend to their obligations; those who have no virtue attend to their claims.\nHeaven's Reason shows no preference but always assists the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"In a small country with few people let there be aldermen and mayors who are possessed of power over men but would not use it. Induce people to grieve at death but do not cause them to move to a distance. Although they had ships and carriages, they should find no occasion to ride in them. Although they had armours and weapons, they should find no occasion to don them.\n Induce people to return to [the old custom of] knotted cords and to use them [in the place of writing], to delight in their food, to be proud of their clothes, to be content with their homes, and to rejoice in their customs: then in a neighboring state within sight, the voices of the cocks and dogs would be within hearing, yet the people might grow old and die before they visited one another."},{chapter:81,content:"True words are not pleasant; pleasant words are not true. The good are not contentious; the contentious are not good. The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe holy man hoards not. The more he does for others, the more he owns himself. The more he gives to others, the more will he himself lay up an abundance.\nHeaven's Reason is to benefit but not to injure; the holy man's Reason is to accomplish but not to strive.'"}]},{name:"Isabella Mears",component:[{chapter:1,content:"Tao that can be expressed is not Everlasting Tao.\nThe name that can be named is not the Everlasting Name.\nThe Name, in its inner aspect, is Life-Spring of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Name, in its outer aspect, is Mother of all created things.\nTherefore:\nTo perceive the mystery of Life, desire always to reach the innermost.\nTo perceive the limitations of things, desire always to posses them.\nThese two aspects of Life are One.\nIn their out-come they become different in Name but in their depth they are One.\nIn a depth, still deeper yet, is the Door of many mysteries."},{chapter:2,content:'All men know the existence of beauty,\nBeauty, cleft asunder, is ugliness.\nAll men know the existence of Love.\nLove, cleft asunder, is hatred.\nTherefore ""possessions"" and ""Inner Life"" interdepend in life.\nDifficult and easy interdepend in completeness.\nLong and short interdepend in form.\nHigh and low interdepend in alternation.\nTone and voice interdepend in harmony.\nBefore and after interdepend in sequence.\nThat is why the self-controlled man\nmakes it his business to dwell in the Inner Life;\nhe teaches not by words, but by actions;\nhe brings all beings into action, he does not refuse them;\nhe gives them life, but does not possess them;\nhe acts, but does not look for reward;\nhe works out perfectness, but claims no credit.\nThe Master, indeed, rests not on rewards.\nThat is why he passes not away.'},{chapter:3,content:"Exalt not men, so that the people may not fight.\nPrize not rare objects, so that the people may not steal.\nLook not on desirable things, so that the people's hearts be not troubled.\nThat is why the self-controlled man governs by stilling the emotions, by quieting thought, by mastering the will, by increasing strength.\nHe always teaches the people to know the Inner Life, to desire the Inner Life.\nHe teaches the Masters of knowledge to cease from activity, to act through activity of the Inner Life; then Inner Life will govern all."},{chapter:4,content:"Tao is infinite.\nIf we use It, we find It inexhaustible,\nDeep!\nIt appears to be Ancestor of all things.\nIt rounds our angles.

harmoniously to produce sweet dew;\nIt gathers the people in the bonds of time and individuality.\nThe Name produces, divides, and brings to life;\nThings produced ever return into the name.\nThe Master also shall know how to rest in it.\nKnowing how to rest in it means that he never will decay.\nOn the earth everywhere Tao exists,\nAs the waters are collected in the valleys\nAnd return into the rivers and the seas."},{chapter:33,content:"He who knows men is wise,\nHe who knows himself can see clearly.\nHe who conquers men has strength,\nHe who conquers himself has power\nHe who knows that he has enough is rich,\nHe who acts with energy has a strong will.\nHe who fails not to find the Self shall endure,\nHe who dies, but does not perish, shall endure for

possesses not a Name.\nIt protects them with love and sustains them, but does not claim to be Ruler of their actions.\nAlways seeking the innermost, you may say that Its Name is in the Small.\nAll beings return again into It, yet It does not claim to be Ruler of their actions.\nYou may say that Its Name is in the Great.\nThat is why, to the end of his life, the self-controlled man is not great in action,\nThus he is able to perfect his greatness."},{chapter:35,content:'Hold fast the idea of ""The Great,""\nThen all men will be drawn to you.\nThey will come to you and receive no hurt,\nBut rest, peace and great calm.\nWhen you provide music and exquisite food\nThe traveller will stay with you gladly.\nWhen the Tao flows out from you to him\nBy his palate he does not detect its savour,\nBy his eye he cannot perceive it,\nBy his ears he cannot hear it,\nBut in using it he finds it to be inexhaustible.'},{chapter:36,content:"If you desire to breathe deeply, you must first empty the lungs.\nIf you desire to be strong, you must first learn to be weak.\nIf you desire to be in a lofty position, you must first learn to take a lowly position.\nIf you desire to be enriched by gifts, you must first give away all that you have.\nThis is called concealment and enlightenment.\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish cannot swim safely in shallow

the innermost.\nIf prince and people can maintain it together,\nAll beings will be transformed from within themselves;\nBeing transformed, they again desire action.\nWe must learn to still desire\nTo obtain in the Inner Life Purity of the Name.\nPurity of the Name in the Inner Life\nBrings absence of desire;\nAbsence of desire brings stillness;\nThus shall the world be perfected from within itself."},{chapter:38,content:"To assume virtue without being really virtuous is to be virtuous from duty;\nTo be less virtuous, yet not to lose real virtue, is to be virtuous from Inner Life.\nSupreme virtue comes through activity of Inner Life; then let us actively seek Inner Life.\nTO be less virtuous and to practice it, let us be active in the performance of duty.\nTo assume benevolence and practice it let us actively seek Inner Life.\nTo assume right conduct and practice it let us be active in the performance of duty.\nTo assume expediency and practice it is to find that no one honours it; then it bares the arm, and asserts itself by force.\nTherefore, when Tao is lost, follow Virtue; when virtue is lost, follow benevolence; when benevolence is lost, follow right conduct; when right conduct is lost, follow expediency.\nThose who are Masters of expediency have in the heart only the shadow of faith; and in the mind only confusion.\nThose who are Leaders of politeness have only the husk of Tao, which is the source of ignorance.\nThat is why the greatest of the Masters abide in the real,\nThey do not abide in the shadow.\nThey hold to the fruit, they do

enriched.\nBy activity of Tao we are daily diminished, diminished and yet more diminished, until we arrive at activity of Inner Life, and activity of Inner Life becomes stillness of Inner Life.\nBy

people, the more do they make artificial things.\nThe more the laws are in evidence, the more do thieves and robbers abound.\nThat is why the self-controlled man says:\nIf I act from Inner Life the

reserve.\nThe Master indeed has a reserve; it is called brilliant foresight.\nBrilliant foresight is called the increasing abundance of Teh.\nIf you have an ever-increasing abundance of Teh , then

by stillness.\nIn order to be still, we must become lowly.\nTherefore, if a great kingdom is lowly towards a little kingdom it will take possession of the little kingdom.\nIf a little kingdom is lowly towards a great kingdom it will take possession of the great kingdom.\nSo one becomes lowly in order to conquer,\nThe other is lowly and yet it conquers.\nIf a great kingdom only desires to unify and nourish men,\nIf a small kingdom only desires to enter in and serve men,\nThen the Master, in each case, shall obtain his desire.\nHe who is great ought to be lowly."},{chapter:62,content:"He who has the Tao is the refuge of all beings.\nHe is the treasure of the good man,\nHe is the support of the man who is not good.\nBeautiful words through Tao gain power,\nMan, by following it gains

Life.\nBe fragrant, with the Fragrance of Inner Life.\nThe great shall be small,\nThe many shall be few, and\nEvil shall be recompensed by goodness.\nMediate on difficult things till they become easy.\nDo great deeds till they appear to be small.\nTo serve men in difficult things,\nWe must begin by easy things.\nTo serve men in great things,\nWe must begin by doing small things.\nThat is why the self-controlled man to the end of life does not become great, and thus he can perfect his greatness.\nThe Master has little faith in a quickly mad promise.\nMany things are easy, many are also difficult.\nThe self-controlled man takes hold of difficulties.\nTo the end of life he solves difficulties in the Inner Life."},{chapter:64,content:"His Restfulness is easily maintained.\nEvents

thousand miles began with a footstep on the ground.\nHe who makes, unmakes.\nHe who grasps, lets go.\nThat is why the self-controlled man by Inner Life can make and by Inner life unmake, by Inner Life can grasp and by Inner Life let go.\nMen in business affairs come near perfection, then fail.\nIf they were as attentive at the end as at the beginning their business would succeed.\nThat is why the self-controlled man desires to have no wishes; he sets no value upon rare objects; he learns without study; he helps all beings by the outflow of his personality; and he does this without planning to do it."},{chapter:65,content:"Of Old, he who was active in Tao did not use it to make people enlightened, but to make them more kind.\nIf people are difficult to govern it is because they have too much knowledge.\nTherefore if you govern a kingdom by knowledge, you will be an oppressor of the kingdom.\nBut if you govern a kingdom by wisdom, you will give happiness to the kingdom.\nIf you know and do these things you will be a pattern for men.\nKnowledge of how to be always a pattern for men is called profound Teh.\nProfound Teh is in the very source of life, it pervades the utmost limits

Lords of a hundred valleys\nLet your love flow, seek a lowly place, you will be Lord of a hundred valleys.\nThat is why if the self-controlled man desires to exalt the people, in his speech he must take a lowly place; if he desires to put the put the people first he must put himself after them.\nThus, though he dwells above them, the people are not burdened by him\nThough he is placed before them, the people are not obstructed by him,\nTherefore men serve him gladly, they do not tire in serving him.\nBecause he does not strive, no one in the world can strive against

the former."},{chapter:73,content:"A man with courage and daring is slain,\nA man with courage and self-restraint lives.\nOf these two, the one has benefit, the other has injury.\nWho can tell why one of them should incur Heaven's Wrath?\nBecause of this the self-controlled man has doubt and difficulty.\nHeavenly Tao strives not, but conquers by love;\nIt speaks not, but responds in Love;\nIt calls not to men, but of themselves they come;\nIt slowly is made manifest, yet its plans are laid in Love.\nThe net of Heaven is widely meshed; the meshes are far apart, yet nothing escapes from it."},{chapter:74,content:"If the people do not fear death,\nHow then can you frighten them by death?\nBut if you cause the people continually to fear death,\nAnd if one of them becomes a great criminal,\nCan you take hold of him and slay him?\nWould you dare to this?\nThere is always one, the Executioner, who kills men.\nBut, on the contrary, if you kill as if you were Executioner,\nIt would be as if you tried to do the work of a Master Carpenter.\nIn attempting to do the work of a Master Carpenter,\nFew there be who do not wound their own hands."},{chapter:75,content:"The people

easy to know the inner meaning of this: ""That which is weak conquers the strong, that which is soft conquers the hard.""\nAll men know this, No one is able to practice it.\nThat is why the

He satisfieth their desires, thus fulfilling their wills, and making them frictionless; and he maketh them strong in body, to a similar end.\nHe delivereth them from the restlessness of knowledge and the cravings of discontent. As to those who have knowledge already, he teacheth them the way of non-action. This being assured, there is no disorder in the world.

Disgrace is the fall from favour. He then that hath favour hath fear, and its loss begetteth fear yet greater of a further fall. What is this which is written concerning honour and calamity?

It moveth all continuously, without Expression, returning into Naught. It is the Form of That which is beyond Form; it is the Image of the Invisible; it is Change, and Without Limit.\nWe confront it, and see not its Face;  we pursue it, and its Back is hidden from us. Ah! but apply the Tao as in old Time to the work of the present; know it as it was known in the Beginning; follow fervently the Thread of the Tao. "},{chapter:15,content:"The adepts of past ages were subtle and keen to apprehend this Mystery, and their profundity was obscurity unto men. Since then they were not known, let me declare their nature.\nTo all seeming, they were fearful as men that cross a torrent in winter flood; they were hesitating like a man in apprehension of them that are about him; they were full of awe like a guest in a great house; they were ready to disappear like ice in thaw; they were unassuming like unworked wood; they were empty as a valley; and dull as the waters of a marsh.\nWho can clear muddy water? Stillness will accomplish this. Who can obtain rest? Let motion continue equably, and it will itself be peace.\nThe adepts of the Tao, conserving its way, seek not to be actively self-conscious. By their emptiness of Self  they have no need to show their youth and perfection; to appear old and imperfect is their privilege. "},{chapter:16,content:"Emptiness must be perfect, and Silence made absolute with tireless strength. All things pass through the period of action; then they return to repose. They grow, bud, blossom and fruit; then they return to the root. This return to the root is this state which we name Silence; and this Silence is Witness of their Fulfilment.\nThis cycle is the universal law. To know it is the part of intelligence; to ignore it bringeth folly of action, whereof the end is madness. To know it bringeth understanding and peace; and these lead to the identification of the Self with the Not-Self. This identification maketh man a king; and this kingliness groweth unto godhood. That godhood beareth fruit in the mastery of the Tao. Then the man, the Tao permeating him, endureth; and his bodily principles are in harmony,  proof against decay, until the hour of his Change. "},{chapter:17,content:"In the Age of Gold, the people were not conscious of their rulers; in the Age of Silver, they loved them, with songs; in the Age of Brass, they feared them; in the Age of Iron, they despised them. As the rulers lost confidence, so also did the people lose confidence in them.\nHow hesitating did they seem, the Lords of the Age of Gold, speaking with deliberation, aware of the weight of their word! Thus they accomplished all things with success; and the people deemed their well-being to be the natural course of events. "},{chapter:18,content:"When men abandoned the Way of the Tao, benevolence and justice became necessary. Then also was need of wisdom and cunning, and all fell into illusion. When harmony ceased to prevail in the six spheres it was needful to govern them by manifesting Sons.\nWhen the kingdoms and races became confused, loyal ministers had to appear. "},{chapter:19,content:"If we forgot our statesmanship and our wisdom, it would be an hundred times better for the people. If we forgot our benevolence and our justice, they would become again like sons, folk of good will. If we forget our machines and our business, there would be no knavery.\nThese new methods despised the olden Way, inventing fine names to disguise their baneness. But simplicity in the doing of the will of every man would put an end to vain ambitions and desires. "},{chapter:20,content:'To forget learning is to end trouble. The smallest difference in words, such as ""yes"" and ""yea"", can make endless controversy for the scholar. Fearful indeed is death, since all men fear it; but the abyss of questionings, shoreless and bottomless, is worse!\nConsider the profane man, how he preeneth, as if at feast, or gazing upon Spring from a tower! But as for me, I am as one who yawneth, without any trace of desire. I am like a babe before its first smile. I appear sad and forlorn, like a man homeless. The profane man hath his need filled, ay, and more also. For me, I seem to have lost all I had. My mind is as it were stupefied; it hath no definite shape. The profane man looketh lively and keen-witted; I alone appear blank in my mind. They seem eagerly critical; I appear careless and without perception. I seem to be as one adrift upon the sea, with  no thought of an harbor. The profane have each one his definite course of action; I alone appear useless and uncomprehending, like a man from the border. Yea, thus I differ from all other men: but my jewel is the All-Mother! '},{chapter:21,content:"The sole source of energy is the Tao. Who may declare its nature? It is beyond Sense, yet all form is hidden within it. It is beyond Sense, yet all Perceptibles are hidden within it. It is beyond Sense, yet all Perceptibles are hidden within it. It is beyond Sense, yet all Being is hidden within it. This Being excites Perception, and the Word thereof. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, its Name operateth continuously, causing all to flow in the cycle of Change, which is Love and Beauty. How do I know this? By my comprehension of the Tao."},{chapter:22,content:'The part becometh the whole. The curve becometh straight; the void becometh full; the old becometh new. He who desireth little accomplisheth his Will with ease; who desireth many things becometh distracted.\nTherefore, the sage concentrateth upon one Will, and it is as a light to the whole world. Hiding himself, he shineth; withdrawing himself, he attracteth notice; humbling himself, he is exalted; dissatisfied with himself, he gaineth force to achieve his Will. Because he striveth not, no man may contend against him.\nThat is no idle saw of the men of old; ""The part becometh the whole""; it is the Canon of Perfection. '},{chapter:23,content:"To keep silence is the mark of one who is acting in full accordance with his Will. A fierce wind soon falleth; a storm-shower doth not last all day. Yet Heaven and Earth cause these; and if they fail to make violence continue, how much less can man abide in spasm of passion!\nWith him that devoteth him to Tao, the devotees of Tao are in accord; so also are the devotees of Teh, yea, even they who fail in seeking those are in accord.\nSo then his brothers in the Tao are joyful, attaining it; and his brothers in the Teh are joyful, attaining it; and they who fail in seeking these are joyful, partaking of it. But if he himself realize not the Tao with calm of confidence, then they also appear lacking in confidence. "},{chapter:24,content:"He who standeth a-tiptoe standeth not firm; he who maketh rigid his legs walketh ill. He who preeneth himself shineth not; he who talketh positively is vulgar; he who boastheth is refused acceptance; he who is wise in his own conceit is thought inferior. Such attitudes, to him that hath the view given by understanding the Tao, seem like garbage or like cancer, abhorrent to all. They then who follow the Way do not admit them."},{chapter:25,content:"Without Limit and Perfect, there is a Becoming, beyond Heaven and Earth. It hath nor motion nor Form; it is alone, it changeth not; it extendeth all ways; it hath no Adversary. It is like the All-Mother.\nI know not its Name, but I call it the Tao. Moreover, I exert myself, and call it Vastness.\nVastness, the Becoming! Becoming, it flieth afar. Afar, it draweth near. Vast is this Tao; Heaven also is Vast; Earth is vast; and the Holy King is vast also. In the Universe are Four Vastnesses, and of these is the Holy King.\nMan followeth the formula of Earth; Earth followeth that of Heaven, and Heaven that of the Tao. The formula of the Tao is its own Nature. "},{chapter:26,content:"Mass is the fulcrum of mobility; stillness is the father of motion.\nTherefore the sage King, though he travel afar, remaineth near his supplies. Though opportunity tempt him, he remaineth quietly in proper disposition, indifferent. Should the master of an host of chariots bear himself frivolously? If he attack without support, he loseth his base; if he become a raider, he forfeiteth his throne. "},{chapter:27,content:"The experienced traveler concealeth his tracks; the clever speaker giveth no chance to the critic; the skilled mathematician useth no abacus; the ingenious safesmith baffleth the burglar without the use of bolts, and the cunning binder without ropes and knots. So also the sage, skilled in man-emancipation-craft, useth all men; understanding the value of everything, he rejecteth nothing. This is called the Occult Regimen.\nThe adept is then master to the zelator, and the zelator assisteth and honoreth the adept. Yet unless these relations were manifest, even the most intelligent observer might be perplexed as to which was which. This is called the Crown of Mystery. "},{chapter:28,content:"Balance thy male strength with thy female weakness and thou shalt attract all things, as the ocean absorbeth all rivers; for thou shalt formulate the excellence of the Child eternal, simple, and perfect.\nKnowing the light, remain in the Dark. Manifest not thy Glory, but thine obscurity. Clothed in this Child-excellence eternal, thou hast attained the Return of the First State. Knowing splendour of Fame, cling to Obloquy and Infamy; then shalt thou remain as in the Valley to which flow all waters, the lodestone to fascinate all men. Yea, they shall hail in thee this Excellence, eternal, simple and perfect, of the Child.\nThe raw material, wrought into form, produceth vessels. So the sage King formulateth his Wholeness in divers Offices; and his Law is without violence or constraint. "},{chapter:29,content:"He that, desiring a kingdom, exerteth himself to obtain it, will fail. A Kingdom is of the nature of spirit, and yieldeth not to activity. He who graspeth it, destroyeth it; he who gaineth it, loseth it.\nThe wheel of nature revolveth constantly; the last becometh first, and the first last; hot things grow cold, and cold things hot; weakness overcometh strength; things gained are lost anon. Hence the wise man avoideth effort, desire and sloth. "},{chapter:30,content:"If a king summon to his aid a Master of the Tao, let Him not advise recourse to arms. Such action certainly bringeth the corresponding reaction.\nWhere armies are, are weeds. Bad harvests follow great hosts.\nThe good general striketh decisively, once and for all. He does not risk by overboldness. He striketh, but doth not vaunt his victory. He striketh according to strict law of necessity, not from desire of victory.\nThings become strong and ripe, then age. This is discord with the Tao; and what is not at one with the Tao soon cometh to an end. "},{chapter:31,content:"Arms, though they be beautiful, are of ill omen, abominable to all created beings. They who have the Tao love not their use.\nThe place of honour is on the right in wartime; so thinketh the man of distinction. Sharp weapons are ill-omened, unworthy of such a man; he useth them only in necessity. He valueth peace and ease, desireth not violence of victory. To desire victory is to desire the death of men; and to desire that is to fail to propitiate the people.\nAt feasts, the left hand is the high seat; at funerals, the right. The second in command of the army leadeth the left wing, the commander-in-chief, the right wing; it is as if the battle were a rite of mourning! He that hath slain most men should weep for them most bitterly; so then the place of the victor is assigned to him with philosophical propriety. "},{chapter:32,content:"The All-Tao hath no name.\nIt is That Minute Point yet the whole world dare not contend against him that hath it. Did a lord or king gain it and guard it, all men would obey him of their own accord.\nHeaven and Earth combining under its spell, shed forth dew, extending throughout all things of its own accord, without man's interference.\nTao, in its phase of action, hath a name. Then men can comprehend it; when they do this, there is no more risk of wrong or ill-success.\nAs the great rivers and the oceans are to the valley streams, so is the Tao to the whole universe. "},{chapter:33,content:"He who understandeth others understandeth Two; but he who understandeth himself understandeth One. He who conquereth others is strong; but he who conquereth himself is stronger yet.\nContentment is riches; and continuous action is Will.\nHe that adapteth himself perfectly to his environment, continueth for long; he who dieth without dying, liveth for ever. "},{chapter:34,content:"The Tao is immanent; it extendeth to the right hand as to the left.\nAll things derive from it their being; it createth them, and all comply with it. Its work is done, and it proclaimeth it not. It is the ornament of all things, yet it claimeth not fief of them; there is nothing so small that it inhabiteth not, and informeth it.\nAll things return without knowledge of the Cause thereof; there is nothing so great that it inhabiteth not, and informeth it.\nIn this manner also may the Sage perform his Works. It is by not thrusting himself forward that he winneth to his success. "},{chapter:35,content:"The whole world is drawn to him that hath the likeness of the Tao. Men flock unto him, and suffer no ill, but gain repose, find peace, enjoy all ease.\nSweet sounds and cates lure the traveler from his way. But the Word of the Tao; though it appear harsh and insipid, unworthy to hearken or to behold; hath his use all inexhaustible. "},{chapter:36,content:"In order to draw breath, first empty the lungs; to weaken another, first strengthen him; to overthrow another, first exalt him; to despoil another, first load him with gifts; this is called the Occult Regimen.\nThe soft conquereth the hard; the weak pulleth down the strong.\nThe fish that leaveth ocean is lost; the method of government must be concealed from the people. "},{chapter:37,content:"The Tao proceedeth by its own nature, doing nothing; therefore there is no doing which it comprehendeth not.\nIf kings and princes were to govern in this manner, all things would operate aright by their own motion.\nIf this transmutation were my object, I should call it Simplicity. Simplicity hath no name nor purpose; silently and at ease all things go well. "},{chapter:38,content:"Those who possessed perfectly the powers did not manifest them, and so they preserved them. Those who possessed them imperfectly feared to lose them, and so lost them.\nThe former did nothing, nor had need to do. The latter did, and had need to do.\nThose who possessed benevolence exercised it, and had need it; so also was it with them who possessed justice.\nThose who possessed the conventions displayed them; and when men would not agree, they made ready to fight them.\nThus, when the Tao was lost, the Magick Powers appeared; then, by successive degradations, came Benevolence, Justice, Convention. \nNow convention is the shadow of loyalty and good will, and so the herald of disorder. Yea, even Understanding is but a Blossom of the Tao, and foreshadoweth Stupidity.\nSo then the Tao-Man holdeth to Mass, and avoideth Motion; he is attached to the Root, not to the flower. He leaveth the one, and cleaveth to the other. "},{chapter:39,content:'These things have possessed the Tao from the beginning: Heaven, clear and shining; Earth, steady and easy; Spirits, mighty in Magick; Vehicles, overflowing with Joy; all that hath life; and the rulers of men. All these derive their essence from the Tao.\nWithout the Tao, Heaven would dissolve Earth disrupt, Spirits become impotent; Vehicles empty; living things would perish and rulers lose their power.\nThe root of grandeur is humility, and the strength of exaltation in its base. Thus rulers speak of themselves as ""Fatherless,"" ""Virtueless,\' ""Unworthy,"" proclaiming by this that their Glory is in their shame. So also the virtue of a Chariot is not any of the parts of a Chariot, if they be numbered. They do not seek to appear fine like jade, but inconspicuous like common stone. '},{chapter:40,content:"The Tao proceeds by correlative curves, and its might is in weakness.\nAll things arose from the Teh, and the Teh budded from the Tao. "},{chapter:41,content:"The best students, learning of the Tao, set to work earnestly to practice the Way. Mediocre students now cherish it, now let it go.\nThe worst students mock at it. Were it not thus mocked, it were unworthy to be Tao.\nThus spake the makers of Saws: the Tao at its brightest is obscure. Who advanceth in that Way, retireth. Its smooth Way is rough. Its summit is a valley. Its beauty is ugliness. Its wealth is poverty. Its virtue, vice. Its stability is change. Its form is without form. Its fullness is vacancy. Its utterance is silence. Its reality is illusion.\nNameless and imperceptible is the Tao; but it informeth and perfecteth all things. "},{chapter:42,content:"The Tao formulated the One.\nThe One exhaled the Two.\nThe Two were parents of the Three.\nThe Three were parents of all things.\nAll things pass from Obscurity to Manifestation, inspired harmoniously by the Breath of the Void.\nMen do not like to be fatherless, virtueless, unworthy: yet rulers describe themselves by these names. Thus increase bringeth decrease to some, and decrease bringeth increase to others.\nOthers have taught thus; I consent to it. Violent men and strong die not by natural death. This fact is the foundation of my law. "},{chapter:43,content:"The softest substance hunteth down the hardest; the unsubstantial penetrateth where there is no opening. Here is the Virtue of Inertia.\nFew are they who attain: whose speech is Silence, whose Work is Inertia. "},{chapter:44,content:"What shall it profit a man if he gain fame or wealth, and lose his life?\nIf a man cling to fame or wealth, he risketh what is worth more.\nBe content, not fearing disgrace. Act not, and risk not criticism. Thus live thou long, without alarm. "},{chapter:45,content:"Despise thy masterpieces; thus renew the vigor of thy creation.\nDeem thy fullness emptiness; thus shall thy fullness never be empty.\nLet the straight appear crooked to thee, thy Craft clumsiness; thy Musick discord.\nExercise moderateth cold; stillness heat. To be pure and to keep silence, is the True Law of all that are beneath Heaven. "},{chapter:46,content:"When the Tao beareth away on Earth, men put swift horses to night-carts. When it is neglected, they breed chargers in the border marches.\nThere is no evil worse than ambition; no misery worse than discontent; no crime greater than greed. Content of mind is peace and satisfaction eternal. "},{chapter:47,content:"One need not pass his threshold to comprehend all that is under Heaven, nor to look out from his lattice to behold the Tao Celestial. Nay! but the farther a man goeth, the less he knoweth.\nThe sages acquired their knowledge without travel; they named all things aright without beholding them; and, acting without aim, fulfilled their Wills. "},{chapter:48,content:"The scholar seeketh daily increase of knowing; the sage of Tao daily decrease of doing.\nHe decreaseth it, again and again, until he doth no act with the lust of result. Having attained this Inertia all accomplisheth itself.\nHe who attracteth to himself all that is under Heaven doth so without effort. He who maketh effort is not able to attract it. "},{chapter:49,content:"The wise man hath no fixed principle; he adapteth his mind to his environment.\nTo the good I am good, and to the evil I am good also; thus all become good. To the true I am true, and to the false I am true; thus all become true.\nThe sage appeareth hesitating to the world, because his mind is detached. Therefore the people look and listen to him, as his children; and thus doth he shepherd them. "},{chapter:50,content:"Man cometh into life, and returneth again into death.\nThree men in ten conserve life; three men in ten pursue death.\nThree men also in ten desire to live, but their acts hasten their journey to the house of death. Why is this? Because of their efforts to preserve life.\nBut this I have heard. He that is wise in the economy of his life, whereof he is warden for a season, journeyeth with no need to avoid the tiger or the rhinoceros, and goeth uncorsleted among the warriors with no fear of sword or lance. The rhinoceros findeth in him no place vulnerable to its horn, the tiger to its claws, the weapon to its point. Why is this? Because there is no house of death in his whole body. "},{chapter:51,content:"All things proceed from the Tao, and are sustained by its forth-flowing virtue. Every one taketh form according to his nature, and is perfect, each in his particular Way. Therefore, each and every one of them glorify the Tao, and worship its forth-flowing Virtue.\nThis glorifying of the Tao, this worship of the Teh, is constantly spontaneous, and not by appointment of Law.\nThus the Tao buddeth them out, nurtureth them, developeth them, sustaineth them, perfecteth them, ripeneth them, upholdeth them, and reabsorbeth them.\nIt buddeth them forth, and claimeth not lordship over them; it is overseer of their changes, and boasteth not of his puissance; perfecteth them, and interfereth not with their Ways; this is called the Mystery of its Virtue. "},{chapter:52,content:"The Tao buddeth forth all things under Heaven; it is the Mother of all.\nKnowing the Mother, we may know her offspring. He that knoweth his Mother, and abideth in Her nature, remaineth in surety all his days.\nWith the mouth closed, and the Gates of Breath controlled, he remaineth at ease all his days. With the mouth open, and the Breath directed to outward affairs, he hath no surety all his days.\nTo perceive that Minute Point is True Vision; to maintain the Soft and Gentle is True Strength.\nEmploying harmoniously the Light Within so that it returneth to its Origin, one guardeth even one's body from evil, and keepeth Silence before all men. "},{chapter:53,content:"Were I discovered by men, and charged with government, my first would be lest I should become proud.\nThe true Path is level and smooth; but men love by-paths.\nThey adorn their courts, but they neglect their fields, and leave their storehouses empty. They wear elaborate and embroidered robes; they gird themselves with sharp swords; they eat and drink with luxury; they heap up goods; they are thievish and vainglorious. All this is opposite to the Way of Tao. "},{chapter:54,content:"If a man plant according to the Tao it will never be uprooted; if he thus gather, it will never be lost. His sons and his son's sons, one following another, shall honour the shrine of their ancestor.\nThe Tao, applied to oneself, strengtheneth the Body, to the family, bringeth wealth; to the district, prosperity; to the state, great fortune. Let it be the Law of the Kingdom, and all men will increase in virtue.\nThus we observe its effect in every case, as to the person, the family, the district, the state, and the kingdom.\nHow do I know that this is thus universal under Heaven?\nBy experience. "},{chapter:55,content:"He that hath the Magick powers of the Tao is like a young child. Insects will not sting him or beasts or birds of prey attack him.\nThe young child's bones are tender and its sinews are elastic, but its grasp is firm. It knoweth nothing of the Union of Man and Woman, yet its Organ may be excited. This is because of its natural perfection. It will cry all day long without becoming hoarse, because of the harmony of its being.\nHe who understandeth this harmony knoweth the mystery of the Tao, and becometh a True Sage. All devices for inflaming life, and increasing the vital Breath, by mental effort are evil and factitious.\nThings become strong, then age. This is in discord with the Tao, and what is not at one with the Tao soon cometh to an end. "},{chapter:56,content:"Who knoweth the Tao keepeth Silence; he who babbleth knoweth it not.\nWho knoweth it closeth his mouth and controlleth the Gates of his Breath. He will make his sharpness blunt; he will loosen his complexes; he will tone down his brightness to the general obscurity. This is called the Secret of Harmony.\nHe cannot be insulted either by familiarity or aversion; he is immune to ideas of gain or loss, of honour or disgrace; he is the true man, unequalled under Heaven. "},{chapter:57,content:"One may govern a state by restriction; weapons may be used with skill and cunning; but one acquireth true command only by freedom, given and taken.\nHow am I aware of this? By experience that to multiply restrictive laws in the kingdom impoverisheth the people; the use of machines causeth disorder in state and race alike. The more men use skill and cunning, the more machines there are; and the more laws there are, the more felons there are.\nA wise man has said this: I will refrain from doing, and the people will act rightly of their own accord; I will love Silence, and the people will instinctively turn to perfection; I will take no measures, and the people will enjoy true wealth; I will restrain ambition, and the people will attain simplicity. "},{chapter:58,content:"The government that exerciseth the least care serveth the people best; that which meddleth with everybody's business worketh all manner of harm. Sorrow and joy are bedfellows; who can divine the final result of either?\nShall we avoid restriction? Yea; restriction distorteth nature, so that even what seemeth good in it is evil. For how long have men suffered from misunderstanding of this.\nThe wise man is foursquare, and avoideth aggression; his corners do not injure others. He moveth in a straight line and turneth not aside therefrom; he is brilliant but doth not blind with his brightness. "},{chapter:59,content:"To balance our earthly nature and cultivate our heavenly nature, tread the Middle Path.\nThis Middle Path alone leadeth to the Timely Return to the True Nature. This Timely Return resulteth from the constant gathering of Magick Powers. With that Gathering cometh Control. This Control we know to be without Limit and he who knoweth the Limitless may rule the state.\nHe who possesseth the Tao continueth long. He is like a plant with well-set roots and strong stems. Thus it secureth long continuance of its life. "},{chapter:60,content:"The government of a kingdom is like the cooking of fish.\nIf the kingdom be ruled according to the Tao, the spirits of our ancestors will not manifest their Teh. These spirits have this Teh, but will not turn it against men. It is able to hurt men; so also is the Wise King; but he doth not.\nWhen these powers are in accord, their Good Will produceth the Teh, endowing the people therewith. "},{chapter:61,content:"A state becometh powerful when it resembleth a great river, deep-seated; to it tend all the small streams under Heaven.\nIt is as with the female, that conquereth the male by her Silence. Silence is a form of Gravity.\nThus a great state attracteth small states by meeting their views, and small states attract the great state by revering its eminence. In the first case this Silence gaineth supporters; in the second, favour.\nThe great state uniteth men and nurtureth them; the small state wisheth the good will of the great, and offereth service; thus each gaineth its advantage. But the great state must keep Silence. "},{chapter:62,content:"The Tao is the most exalted of all things. It is the ornament of the good, and the protection and purification of the evil.\nIts words are the fountain of honour, and its deeds the engine of achievement. It is present even in evil.\nThough the Son of Heaven were enthroned with his three Dukes appointed to serve him, and he were offered a round symbol- of-rank as great as might fill the hands, with a team of horses to follow, this gift were not to be matched against the Tao, which might be offered by the humblest of men.\nWhy did they of old time set such store by the Tao? Because he that sought it might find it, and because it was the Purification from all evil. Therefore did all men under Heaven esteem it the most exalted of all things. "},{chapter:63,content:"Act without lust of result; work without anxiety; taste without attachment to flavour; esteem small things great and few things many; repel violence with gentleness.\nDo great things while they are yet small, hard things while they are yet easy; for all things, how great or hard soever, have a beginning when they are little and easy. So thus the wise man accomplisheth the greatest tasks without undertaking anything important.\nWho undertaketh thoughtlessly is certain to fail in attainment; who estimateth things easy findeth them hard. The wise man considereth even easy things hard, so that even hard things are easy to him. "},{chapter:64,content:"It is easy to grasp what is not yet in motion, to withstand what is not yet manifest, to break what is not yet compact, to disperse what is not yet coherent. Act against things before they become visible; attend to order before disorder ariseth.\nThe tree which filleth the embrace grew from a small shoot; the tower nine-storied rose from a low foundation; the ten-day journey began with a single step.\nHe who acteth worketh harm; he who graspeth findeth it a slip. The wise man acteth not, so worketh no harm; he doth not grasp, and so doth not let go. Men often ruin their affairs on the eve of success, because they are not as prudent at the end as in the beginning.\nThe wise man willeth what others do not will, and valueth not things rare. He learneth what others learn not, and gathered up what they despise. Thus he is in accord with the natural course of events, and is not overbold in action. "},{chapter:65,content:"They of old time that were skilled in the Tao sought not to enlighten the people, but to keep them simple.\nThe difficulty of government is the vain knowledge of the people. To use cleverness in government is to scourge the kingdom; to use simplicity is to anoint it.\nKnow these things, and make them thy law and thine example. To possess this Law is the Secret Perfection of rule. Profound and Extended is this Perfection; he that possesseth it is indeed contrary to the rest, but he attracteth them to full accordance. "},{chapter:66,content:"The oceans and the rivers attract the streams by their skill in being lower than they; thus are they masters thereof. So the Wise Man, to be above men, speaketh lowly; and to precede them acteth with humility.\nThus, though he be above them, they feel no burden; nor, though he precede them, do they feel insulted.\nSo then do all men delight to honour him, and grow not weary of him. He contendeth not against any man; therefore no man is able to contend against him. "},{chapter:67,content:"They say that while this Tao of mine is great, yet it is inferior. This is the proof of its greatness. If it were like anything else, its smallness would have long been known.\nI have three jewels of price whereto I cleave; gentleness, economy, and humility.\nThat gentleness maketh me courageous, that economy generous, that humility honoured. Men of today abandon gentleness for violence, economy for extravagance, humility for pride: this is death.\nGentleness bringeth victory in fight; and holdeth its ground with assurance. Heaven wardeth the gentle man by that same virtue. "},{chapter:68,content:'He that is skilled in war maketh no fierce gestures; the most efficient fighter bewareth of anger. He who conquereth refraineth from engaging in battle; he whom men most willingly obey continueth silently with his Work. So it is said: "He is mighty who fighteth not; he ruleth who uniteth with his subjects; he shineth whose will is that of Heaven."'},{chapter:69,content:'A great strategist saith: ""I dare not take the offensive. I prefer the defensive. I dare not advance an inch; I prefer to retreat a foot."" Place therefore the army where there is no army; prepare for action where there is no engagement; strike where there is no conflict; advance against the enemy where the enemy is not.\nThere is no error so great as to engage in battle without sufficient force. To do so is to risk losing the gentleness which is beyond price. Thus when the lines actually engage, he who regretteth the necessity is the victor. '},{chapter:70,content:"My words are easy to understand and to perform; but is there anyone in the world who can understand them and perform them?\nMy words derive from a creative and universal Principle, in accord with the One Law. Men, not knowing these, understand me not.\nFew are they that understand me; therefore am I the more to be valued. The Wise Man weareth sack-cloth, but guardeth his jewel in his bosom. "},{chapter:71,content:"To know, yet to know nothing, is the highest; not to know, yet to pretend to knowledge, is a distemper.\nPainful is this distemper; therefore we shun it. The wise man hath it not. Knowing it to be bound up with Sorrow, he putteth it away from him. "},{chapter:72,content:"When men fear not that which is to be feared, that which they fear cometh upon them.\nLet them not live, without thought, the superficial life. Let them not weary of the Spring of Life!\nBy avoiding the superficial life, this weariness cometh not upon them.\nThese things the wise man knoweth, not showeth: he loveth himself, without isolating his value. He accepteth the former and rejecteth the latter. "},{chapter:73,content:"One man, daring, is executed; another, not daring, liveth. It would seem as if the one course were profitable and the other detrimental. Yet when Heaven smiteth a man, who shall assign the cause thereof? Therefore the sage is diffident.\nThe Tao of Heaven contendeth not, yet it overcometh; it is silent, yet its need is answered; it summoneth none, but all men come to it of their free will. Its method is quietness, yet its will is efficient. Large are the meshes of Heaven's Net; wide open, yet letting none escape. "},{chapter:74,content:"The people have no fear of death; why then seek to awe them by the threat of death? If the people feared death and I could put to death evil-doers, who would dare to offend?\nThere is one appointed to inflict death. He who would usurp that position resembleth a hewer of wood doing the work of a carpenter. Such an one, presumptuous, will be sure to cut his own hands. "},{chapter:75,content:"The people suffer hunger because of the weight of taxation imposed by their rulers. This is the cause of famine.\nThe people are difficult to govern because their rulers meddle with them. This is the cause of bad government.\nThe people welcome death because the toil of living is intolerable. This is why they esteem death lightly. In such a state of insecurity it is better to ignore the question of living than to set store by it. "},{chapter:76,content:"At the birth of man, he is elastic and weak; at his death, rigid and unyielding. This is the common law; trees also, in their youth, are tender and supple; in their decay, hard and dry.\nSo then rigidity and hardness are the stigmata of death; elasticity and adaptability, of life.\nHe then who putteth forth strength is not victorious; even as a strong tree filleth the embrace.\nThus the hard and rigid have the inferior place, the soft and elastic the superior. "},{chapter:77,content:"The Tao of Heaven is likened to the bending of a bow, whereby the high part is brought down, and the low part raised up. The extreme is diminished, and the middle increased.\nThis is the Way of Heaven, to remove excess, and to supplement insufficiency. Not so is the way of man, who taketh away from him that hath not to give to him that hath already excess.\nWho can employ his own excess to the weal of all under Heaven? Only he that possesseth the Tao.\nSo the Wise Man acteth without lust of result; achieveth and boasteth not; he willeth not to proclaim his greatness. "},{chapter:78,content:'Nothing in the world is more elastic and yielding than water; yet it is preeminent to dissolve things rigid and resistant; there is nothing which can match it.\nAll men know that the soft overcometh the hard, and the weak conquereth the strong; but none are able to use this law in action.\nA Wise Man hath said: ""He that taketh on the burden of the state is a demigod worthy of sacrificial worship; and the true King of a people is he that undertaketh the weight of their sorrows.""\nTruth appeareth paradox. '},{chapter:79,content:"When enemies are reconciled, there is always an aftermath of illwill. How can this be useful?\nTherefore, the Wise Man, while he keepeth his part of the record of a transaction, doth not insist on its prompt execution. He who hath the Teh considereth the situation from all sides, while he who hath it not seeketh only to benefit himself.\nIn the Tao of Heaven, there is no distinction of persons in its love; but it is for the True Man to claim it. "},{chapter:80,content:"In a little kingdom of few people it should be the order that though there were men able to do the work of ten men or five score, they should not be employed. Though the people regarded death as sorrowful, yet they should not wish to go elsewhere.\nThey should have boats and wagons, yet no necessity to travel; corslets and weapons, yet no occasion to fight.\nFor communication they should use knotted cords.\nThey should deem their food sweet, their clothes beautiful, their houses homes, their customs delightful.\nThere should be another state within view, so that its fowls and dogs should be heard; yet to old age, even to death, the people should hold no traffic with it. "},{chapter:81,content:"True speech is not elegant; elaborate speech is not truth. Those who know do not argue; the argumentative are without knowledge. Those who have assimilated are not learned; those who are gross with learning have not assimilated.\nThe Wise Man doth not hoard. The more he giveth, the more he hath; the more he watereth, the more is he watered himself.\nThe Tao of Heaven is like an Arrow, yet it woundeth not; and the Wise Man, in all his Works, maketh no contention.

wise,\nRemains with it for aye."},{chapter:36,content:"Only the greater can grow less,\nOnly the strong grow weak;\nAnd he who falls to humbleness\nOnce was not quite so meek.\nHe who is peaceful as a

own ways,\nAsserts not, nor pretends;\nNot virtuous because it pays\nOr helps in making friends.\nBenevolence is that good will\nWhich works without reward;\nHow unlike justice--quick to kill,\nDependent on the sword!\nPropriety lays down its rules,\nAnd then has swift recourse\nTo justice and to sharp-edged tools,\nIts ruling to enforce.\nPropriety is last of all;\nNext justice stands arrayed;\nGood will succeeds to virtue's fall;\nAnd virtue is God's shade.\nTradition is of God the flower,\nBut leads to ignorance;\nFor surely that shall lose its power,\nWhose power does not advance.\nTherefore the holy man eschews\nThe bud, the flower, the fruit;\nExternal things he will refuse,\nReturning to the root."},{chapter:39,content:"In unity is greatest strength,\nIt makes the heavens pure;\nThrough it, minds become souls at length;\nIn it, earth shall endure.\nThrough unity, the valley gains\nRepletion for its fields,\nAnd gathers to itself the rains\nTo multiply its yields.\nThrough unity, ten thousand things\nWere called to life and breath;\nThrough unity, the ancient kings\nControlled both life and death.\nWithout it, heaven might be rent;\nAnd earth might bend awry;\nMinds unensouled be impotent;\nAnd valleys soon run dry.\nWho will not take eternal life,\nHow may he hope to live?\nAnd what can kings expect but strife,\nWho ask more than they give?\nThe nobles and the kings depend\nUpon the commonweal;\nFor he who'd reach his journey's end\nNeeds more than just one wheel.\nWho knows his origin and stem\nIn unity alone,\nWill heed not praising as a gem\nNor scorning as a stone."},{chapter:40,content:"In nothingness is God's great force,\nFrom that, existence came;\nAnd thence, ere He turns to His source,\nAll things with form and name."},{chapter:41,content:"Superior men who hear of it,\nWalk in the Godlike way;\nAnd average men, of lesser wit,\nStrive, but oft disobey.\nBut when the inferior man, the fool,\nTakes the book in his hands,\nHe demonstrates by ridicule\nHow much he understands.\nIt does not deal with lusts of earth\nSuch as all fools perceive,\nSo only men of genuine worth,\nMay know it and believe.\nTherefore 'tis written that God's light\nSeems darkness twice distilled;\nAnd he who leans upon His might,\nSeems weak and feeble-willed.\nWhen he has done his simple best\nHe asks for no reward,\nBut acts as humbly as a guest\nAnd does not play the lord.\nHis virtue is so circumspect\nWho puts in God his trust,\nThat lesser men can but suspect\nHow he conceals their lust.\nWho shows perfection to the less\nCan but expect their hate,\nFor, otherwise, they must confess\nThemselves not quite so great.\nYet only God's self can impart\nCompletion to the soul,\nAnd some day every human heart\nShall comprehend the whole."},{chapter:42,content:"From God was the eternal name,\nAnd thence the Two had birth,\nAnd then the Trinity, whence came\nAll things in heaven and earth.\nSustained by earth,

is gain\nTo one who wears a shroud.\nHow very ancient is this truth\nWhich I propound once more!\nAnd yet it has eternal youth\nBecause it is the law."},{chapter:43,content:"The weakest thing in all the world\nIs water; yet its play,\nBetween the rocky ledges whirled,\nGrinds the hard rock away.\nWater does not assert its might,\nBut follows flow and fall;\nJust so, who lives in wisdom's light\nShall serve and conquer all."},{chapter:44,content:"Which is nearer--self or name?\nWhich dearer--self or gold?\nAnd shall we count these things the same--\nThat which we lose, and hold?\nWhen aged people have great wealth,\nEither they squander all,\nOr thieves and robbers come by stealth\nTo break the treasure hall.\nWho works not for a stated goal,\nOr to avoid a hell,\nShall lose his life and find his soul\nIn joy of working well."},{chapter:45,content:"Perfection is not yet complete,\nOr all would cease to be;\nYet, even then, all would repeat\nThroughout eternity.\nThe straightest lines resemble curves;\nGreat skill is never shown;\nAnd he whom eloquence most serves,\nNever lets it be known.\nBehold how motion conquers cold,\nAnd quietude conquers heat;\nJust so the clear and pure behold\nAll things beneath their feet."},{chapter:46,content:"When men accept God for their needs\nAnd each has all he asks,\nRace horses, and more warlike steeds,\nShall fall to menial tasks.\nHis sin is greatest who is rent\nBy passion and desire;\nThe greatest woe is discontent,\nAnd greed the hottest fire.\nWho takes contentment to his breast\nShall find it pure and whole,\nAnd know the bliss of perfect rest,\nIn an enlightened soul."},{chapter:47,content:"In God, I may prognosticate\nThe world and all its ways,\nYet never pass beyond my gate,\nNor through my window gaze.\nThe further that the traveler goes\nIn strange, exotic lands,\nThe less he sees, the less he knows,\nThe less he understands.\nAnd so the holy man remains,\nAnd does not travel far;\nHis wisdom, not for human brains,\nEmbraces every star.\nBecause he knows the soul of things\nTheir forms he need not meet.\nHe does not labor, yet he brings\nThat which makes all complete."},{chapter:48,content:"Increase will follow learnedness,\nBut, fed from heaven's store,\nThe holy man grows less and less,\nAnd so grows more and more.\nArrived at non-assertion's goal,\nThe throne may be his ward;\nFor none is fit to rule the whole\nWho loves to play the lord."},{chapter:49,content:"The saint does more than stand aside\nFrom passion and from strife;\nThe circle of his heart is wide\nIncluding all with life.\nThose who are good he greets with good,\nAnd greets the bad the same;\nFor thus is goodness understood\nBy those who know its name.\nThe faithful, and the faithless too,\nHe meets with faith serene;\nFor that is how they always do,\nWho know what faith may mean.\nThe nobles treat him with respect,\nHe treats each like a child,\nAnxious, indeed, and circumspect,\nBut tolerant and mild.\nThirteen roadways run through life\nTo thirteen doors of death;\nHomeward, from foolish fears and strife,\nWe float on failing breath."},{chapter:50,content:"Why does man die? Because he lives\nIntensely, with desire.\nIt is intensity that gives\nHis flesh to feed that fire.\nI understand that one whose life\nIs based on perfect good,\nShall walk in safety through fierce strife,\nOr danger-haunted wood.\nHe does not fear the shining blade,\nNor the fierce beast of prey;\nOf mortal stuff hes is not made,\nSo none may touch or slay."},{chapter:51,content:"God quickens, and then virtues feed;\nReality gives form;\nAnd force completes; thus all things heed\nVirtue and virtue's norm.\nNone orders the ten thousand things\nTo join in virtue's praise;\nAnd so spontaneously it springs\nFrom love of virtue's ways.\nTo quicken things, but not to own;\nTo make, but not to claim;\nTo raise, but not to seize the throne:\nThat is eternal fame."},{chapter:52,content:"When the world turns to its youth,\nThen God is recognized\nAs the world-mother, and this truth\nIs understood and prized.\nAs one who knows his mother, so\nIn turn she knows her son;\nShe quickens him and helps him grow,\nAnd guards till life is done.\nWho sets aside desire, and rests\n(closing the gates of sense)\nCalmly upon the mother's breasts,\nEncounters no offense.\nBut he who gives himself to talk,\nAnd meddles with affairs,\nThroughout his life shall seem to walk\nDown dim and dangerous stairs.\nTrue wisdom brings humility;\nThe tender are the strong:\nWho practices these truths shall be\nPreserved from every wrong."},{chapter:53,content:"What little knowledge I possess\nKeeps me secure in grace;\nIn self-assertion growing less,\nSeeking not praise nor place.\nHow broad this mighty roadway seems!\nBut people love the lanes\nThat lead them down beside the streams\nOf pleasures and of pains.\nWhen palaces become immense,\nThe fields are bare of sheaves.\nTo glory in the lusts of sense--\nThis is the pride of thieves!"},{chapter:54,content:"The tree no storm-wind can uproot\nIs planted in deep earth.\nThe treasure none can ever loot\nIs that of greatest worth.\nHis sons and grandsons shall not cease\nTo hold his name in awe,\nWho walks upon the way of peace,\nAnd keeps the perfect law.\nWho walks alone in wisdom's beam,\nHis virtue is not small.\nBut, ah, his virtue is supreme\nWho holds it out to all.\nIt is the way of man to test\nThe unknown by the known;\nBy his own heart he weighs his guest,\nRanks countries by his own."},{chapter:55,content:"He who has God within his heart\nIs like a little child:\nSupremely strong in every part,\nYet tender, soft, and mild.\nThe poisoned sting, the fang, the beak,\nStrike not, nor seize, nor tear;\nHis grasp, although his bones be weak,\nIs firm beyond compare.\nHe does not yield to passion's gusts,\nBut keeps his person pure;\nHe loves indeed, but never lusts,\nAnd so he shall endure.\nWho has this perfect harmony,\nKnows the eternal light;\nBut he who has it not, shall be\nPlunged in perpetual night.n"},{chapter:56,content:"They talk the most who know the least;\nOne who is truly wise\nDoes not presume to play the priest,\nBut shuts his mouth and eyes.\nHe is not moved by love or hate,\nBy favor or disgrace;\nTo loss he is inviolate,\nAnd so he holds his place."},{chapter:57,content:"With rectitude, one rules the states;\nWith craftiness one leads\nThe army; but who serves and waits,\nPerforms the greater deeds.\nThe more their rulers ring them round\nWith rule and law and act,\nThe poorer are the people found\nIn spirit and in fact.\nStates which are best prepared for war\nAre certain to conflict.\nThere is the least regard for law,\nWhere laws are harsh and strict.\nThe holy man will never try\nTo rule wit sword or rod;\nContent to set his standard high;\nHe leaves the rest to God."},{chapter:58,content:"A prying government will do\nThe people endless harm;\nHe is the wiser ruler, who\nGoverns in peace and calm.\nMisery rests on happiness,\nAnd under that again--\nAlthough the foolish cannot guess--\nLie misery and pain.\nThus everything in life depends\nUpon its own reverse;\nAs enemies depend on friends,\nAnd prose depends on verse.\nAnd good on bad, as bad on good;\nAs courage rests on fear:\nOnly the rash and reckless could\nPresume to interfere.\nThe holy man will never feel\nImpatient to improve,\nBecause he knows the mighty wheel\nMust turn in its own groove."},{chapter:59,content:"To govern men is God's affair;\nAnd what presumptuous clod,\nIn awful arrogance, shall dare\nTo take the place of God?\nIndeed he has a mighty task\nWho governs his own soul,\nAnd shall such imperfection ask\nThe right to rule the whole?\nPractising virtue, truth, and thrift,\nHimself, and every day;\nThus only may he hope to lift\nAnother on the way."},{chapter:60,content:"Those rulers who sincerely wish\nTheir service not to fail,\nWill govern as one fries small fish,\nAnd neither gut nor scale.\nWho governs in the holy name,\nAnd not with idle talk,\nShall keep the country's demons tame,\nNor shall its specters walk.\nAnd neither shall the sages, then,\nIncite rebelliousness;\nBut demons, ghosts, and holy men\nShall join to serve and bless."},{chapter:61,content:"A great state, one that lowly flows,\nBecomes the empire's wife;\nBecause, through quietude, she knows\nAnd rules her husband's life.\nThrough lowliness towards small states,\nThe great state conquers all;\nJust as great ones, forcing their fates,\nAre conquered by the small.\nSo some adopt their lowliness\nBecause they wish the name;\nOthers are lowly by duress,\nBut conquer just the same.\nA great state should desire no more\nThan to unite and feed.\nA smaller state, avoiding war,\nMust serve the people's need.\nBut so that both may do their tasks,\nThe greater one must bend;\nNot proudly, but as one who asks\nThe right to serve a friend."},{chapter:62,content:"The universe finds joy and health\nIn him who walks God's way;\nHe is the good man's greatest wealth,\nThe bad man's surest stay.\nWith cunning words, a man may sell\nThat which is poor or bad;\nHad he been honest, who can tell\nWhat gain he might have had?\nIf any man be found with sin,\nShall he be held as naught?\nAnd yet that is the custom in\nThe Emperor's own court.\nBetter than justice, swift to kill,\nAnd urging men to strife,\nIs it to do the Father's will,\nAnd speak the word of life.\nWhy did the ancients prize that word?\nBecause, when sinners craved\nTo hear it, it was always heard,\nAnd so were sinners saved."},{chapter:63,content:"Asserting self invites a fall;\nKeep yourself safe from such;\nLearning to magnify the small,\nAnd make the little much.\nWith perfect love and virtue, woo\nThe one who proffers hate.\nLearn to begin what you must do\nBefore it grows too great.\nRemember that the greatest task,\nThat conquers human will,\nWas tiny once, and did not ask\nVast wisdom or much skill.\nThe wise man will not play the great,\nThus greatness will achieve;\nFor self-assurance tempts ill fate,\nAnd braggarts none believe.\nRegarding nothing as too light\nTo need his utmost skill,\nAll difficulties fade from sight,\nAnd he attains his will."},{chapter:64,content:"Things still at rest need not be feared,\nThey may be kept content;\nAnd that which has not yet appeared,\nTis easy to prevent.\nWhat is still feeble may be burst\nAsunder with a touch;\nWhat is still scant may be dispersed\nBefore it grows too much.\nAnticipate the thing to be,\nAnd so prevent the deed.\nRemember that the stoutest tree\nCame from a tiny seed.\nWith brick on bricks, and tile on tiles,\nOne builds a massive wall.\nThe journey of a thousand miles\nBegins with one footfall.\nWhat common people undertake\nTires them e'er they begin.\nThey only mar what they would make,\nAnd lose what they would win.\nWho does not guard his enterprise\nUntil he gains his goal,\nOften is taken by surprise\nThat robs him of the whole.\nThe wise man limits his desires,\nAnd does not mount too high;\nBut kindles his domestic fires\nWhere multitudes pass by.\nHe helps indeed, with mind and hands,\nWhen nature's will is clear;\nBut otherwise he understands\nAnd does not interfere."},{chapter:65,content:'The ancient ones who ruled of yore,\nAnd knew whereof they spoke,\nSaid: ""Do not cast the sacred lore\nAmong the common folk.\n""Much knowledge will corrupt the

great rivers flow\nTo swell the deeper sea;\nAnd it, because it lies so low,\nGreatest of all may be.\nAnd so the holy man who seeks\nTo serve his people's needs\nMust keep beneath them when he speaks,\nBehind them when he leads.\nBecause he seems no more than they,\nThe people will not hate,\nBut mark his wisdom and obey\nAnd strive to emulate.\nStriving with no one, no one can\nConfront him with the sword.\nThe world will always praise that man\nWho asks for no reward."},{chapter:67,content:"A man must differ to be great;\nWhat greatness is expressed\nBy him who shares the common fate,\nAnd follows all the rest?\nI have three treasures which I prize:\nCompassion first, then thrift,\nAnd third, not daring to arise\nHowever much I lift.\nWho has compassion can be brave,\nAnd who has thrift can give;\nThe life one does not seek to save,\nEnables one to live.\nThose who are brave but never kind,\nGenerous but always poor,\nambitious, not of modest mind:\nThese shall not long

strife.\nWho takes up weapons to be great,\nShall surely lose his life.\nHe shall excel who never strives,\nWho strives shall not excel.\nHe who would govern others' lives\nMust govern his own well.\nAnd that employer is most wise\nWho follows heaven's plan,\nIn learning how to utilize\nThe worth of every man."},{chapter:69,content:'A famous general once observed:\n""Act not the host in

wins.'},{chapter:70,content:"How easy are these words I speak,\nHow simple to achieve!\nYet, through the world, in vain I seek\nFor one who can believe.\nThat which is more than deed and word,\nNo one can comprehend;\nWhat wonder that I am not heard,\nOr, being heard, offend!\nTherefore the holy man confides\nBut little in his kind;\nDresses in wool, and deeply hides\nHis jewels in his mind."},{chapter:71,content:"To know that which is never shown,\nIs spiritual wealth;\nBut not to know what may be known,\nIs madness and ill health.\nYet only those who know their need\nAre anxious to be pure;\nAnd so ill health will often lead\nThe sinner to the cure."},{chapter:72,content:"When people lose the sense of fear,\nThe dreadful shall befall;\nBut life is neither sad nor drear\nTo one who lives it all.\nThe wise man will observe his heart,\nand yield not to displays;\nEndeavoring to play his part,\nHe will not seek for praise."},{chapter:73,content:"Daring is deadly; courage leads\nTo life, serene and calm;\nYet both of these contain the seeds\nOf benefit and harm.\nThe heavenly reason never strives,\nYet is its purpose pure.\nThough it speaks not, nor seems alive,\nIts victory is sure.\nThe net of heaven is vast, so vast;\nIts meshes wide, so wide;\nAnd yet it gathers all things fast,\nAnd none is left outside."},{chapter:74,content:"If folk were not afraid to

we, too, dare to kill?\nWhen human beings arrogate\nThe right to judge and slay,\nThey but usurp the power of fate\nWhich none but God may sway.\nSo tightly binds the mystic mesh\nThat winds about the

If you possess the mother of the\nstate, you may long endure.\n This is called the deep root and the solid trunk; it is the dao of long gazing\nupon enduring life."},{chapter:60,content:"Governing a large state is like cooking a small fish.\n When one approaches governing the world by means of the Dao, ghosts will\nhave no potency. It is not that they have no potency, but that their\npotency will not harm people, It is not that their potency will not\nharm people, but that the sage too will not harm people. These two\nwill do no mutual harm, and therein will virtue (de) commingle and\nreturn."},{chapter:61,content:"A large state lies downstream; it is the female of the world. In intercourse,\nthe female overcomes the male by means of stillness, because stillness\nlies below. Thus when the large state takes the lower position it\ncontrols the small state. When a small state takes the lower position, it\nplaces itself under the control of the large state. In the one case the\nstate takes the lower position to control, in the other it takes the lower\nposition to place itself under control.\nLarge states wish no more than to annex and nurture people; small states\nwish no more than to enter into service. Both gain what they wish.\nIt is appropriate that the large dwell below."},{chapter:62,content:"The Dao is the altar of the things of the world. It is the treasure of the good\nperson and the protection of the bad person.\nFine words can be marketed; honorable conduct can add to one\u2019s rank. As\nfor the bad person, how can they be abandoned?\n Hence when the Son of Tian assumes the throne, in appointing the three high\nministers, he who bears the jade disk of court and presents a team of\nhorses is not esteemed so much as he who sits in place and offers this\ndao.\n Why was this dao so esteemed in the past? Is it not said that by means of it\none will get what one seeks, and transgressors will evade punishment?\nHence it was esteemed by the world."},{chapter:63,content:"Engage in non-action, undertake having no undertakings, taste the tasteless.\nEnlarge the small, increase the few, requite hostility with virtue (de).\n Plan for the difficult on the basis of the simple, do great things on the basis of\ndetails \u2013 the difficult undertakings of the world are all arise from\nsimple situations, and the greatest undertakings in the world all arise\nfrom small details.\n Hence the sage never does a great act, and is thus able to complete his\ngreatness.\n Thoughtless assent always brings little trust; many easy acts always lead to\nmany difficulties. Therefore the sage seems to treat them as difficult,\nand thus never has difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"When things are at rest they are easy to maintain; when situations have not\nyet emerged they are easy to plan for. When brittle, things are easy to\nsplit; when minute things are easy to disperse.\nDeal with things before they occur; order things before they are disordered.\n A tree trunk several arm spans round was born of the tiniest seed. Towers\nnine stories high rise from foundations of piled earth. A journey of a\nthousand li begins with the first footfall.\n He who acts, fails; he who grasps, loses.\nTherefore the sage takes no action (wuwei) and hence has no failure, does no\ngrasping and hence takes no loss.\n When people pursue an undertaking, it is always at the point of success that\nthey ruin it. Attend at the end as you did at the start and you will have\nno failures.\n Therefore, the sage desires not to desire and does not value goods hard to\ncome by; he learns not to learn and redeems the errors of the masses.\nAssisting the things of the world to be as they are in themselves, he dares not\nact."},{chapter:65,content:"Men of the past who were good at following the Dao did not use it to\nenlighten the people, they used it to make them ignorant. People are\ndifficult to govern is when they have much knowledge.\n Hence one who governs by means of knowledge plunders the state; one who\ndoes not govern by means of knowledge brings fortune to the state.\nIndeed, these two constitute the standard \u2013 to be always aware of the\nstandard is called dark virtue (de).\n Dark virtue is profound, far reaching; it revolves together with things. Only\nthen does it attain great compliance."},{chapter:66,content:"The reason that the Yangzi and the sea rule as kings over hundreds of river\nvalleys is because they know well to take the lower position;\nthat is why they rule as kings over hundreds of river valleys.\nHence if you wish to rule above the people you must employ words to take\nthe lower position; if you wish to lead people you must place\nyourself behind them.\nTherefore, the sage dwells above and the people don\u2019t consider him heavy, he\nstands ahead of them and they do not consider it an injury to\nthem. Hence the world delights in supporting him untiringly.\nBecause he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"All in the world say my dao is huge, but appears to be worthless. It is indeed\nbecause it is huge that it appears worthless. If it were worthy would it\nnot long since have become small?\n I possess three treasures; I protect them in my grasp. One is compassion, the\nsecond is frugality, and third, I dare not take the lead in the world.\nCompassionate, thus I can have valor; frugal, thus I can extend my\nterritory; unwilling to take the lead in the world, thus my works\nendure.\n Now were I to discard compassion in favor of valor, frugality in favor of\nterritory, taking my place behind in favor of leading, I would die.\n He who goes to battle with compassion prevails; who defends his state with\ncompassion will be impregnable. He whom Tian wishes to save it\nprotects by means of compassion."},{chapter:68,content:"A good warrior does not act fearsome; one good at battle does not become\nangry; one good at defeating the enemy does not contest; one good at\ndirecting people takes the lower position.\nThis is the virtue of not contending; this is called directing the strength of\nothers; this is called companion to Tian \u2013 the utmost limit of the past."},{chapter:69,content:"Military strategists have a saying: I dare not act as the host, but rather the\nguest; I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.\nThis is called walking where there is no road, rolling up the sleeve where\nthere is no arm, grasping where there is no weapon, struggling where\nthere is no enemy.\n There is no calamity greater than having no enemy, without an enemy, I have\nalmost lost my treasure. Thus when two matched armies contest, it is\nthe victor that mourns."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are so easy to understand and so easy to put in practice; none in\nthe world can understand or practice them.\n Words have a governing meaning, affairs have a ruling actor.\n It is because they are have no knowledge that they do not understand me.\nThose who understand me are few; those who emulate me are\nesteemed.\n Therefore, the sage wears coarse clothes and conceals in them a precious jade."},{chapter:71,content:"To know you do not know is best; not to know that one does not know is to be\nflawed.\nOne who sees his flaws as flaws is therefore not flawed.\nThe sage is flawless. He sees his flaws as flaws, therefore he is flawless."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people do not hold the awesome in awe, awful events occur.\n Do not narrow their living space nor crush their means of livelihood. Because\nyou do not crush them, they will not view you as a crushing burden.\n Therefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself, cherishes\nhimself but does not honor himself.\nThus he discards the one and takes the other."},{chapter:73,content:"One who is valiant in being daring will be killed. One who is valiant in being\ntimid will live. Of these two, one is profitable and one is harmful.\n Who knows why Tian hates what it hates? Even the sage takes this to be\ndifficult.\n The dao of Tian excels at prevailing though it does not contend; it excels at\nresponding, though it does not speak; things come of themselves\nthough it does not summon; it excels at planning though it is flexible.\n The net of Tian is vast; though the mesh is broadly spaced, nothing gets\nthrough."},{chapter:74,content:"If the people do not fear death, what good is threatening them with death? If\nyou make the people ever fearful of death and threaten to execute any\nwho innovate new things, who will dare to do so?\n Always have an executioner whose charge it is to kill. One who takes the\nplace of an executioner is like one who takes the carpenter\u2019s place in\nhewing wood. Few who take the carpenter\u2019s place fail to wound their\nhands."},{chapter:75,content:"When the people starve it is because their ruler extracts too much in taxes,\nthat is why they starve. When the people are hard to govern it is\nbecause their ruler takes action, that is why they are hard to govern.\nWhen the people regard death as unimportant it is because they seek\nlife too assiduously, that is why they regard death as unimportant.\nIt is precisely doing nothing for the sake of life that makes one worthier than\nthose who value life."},{chapter:76,content:"When born, people are pliant and weak; when they die they are stiff and\nstrong. The things of the world, such as trees and grasses, are born pliant\nand fragile; they die shriveled and dry.\n Thus the hard and strong are followers of death; the pliant and weak are\nfollowers of life.\n Therefore, when a weapon is strong it cannot conquer; when a tree is strong\nit is put to the axe. The strong and great dwell below; the pliant and weak\ndwell above."},{chapter:77,content:"The dao of Tian is like the stretching of a bow: the high is brought down and\nthe low is raised up; it takes from what has abundance and supplies\nwhat is wanting. The dao of Tian takes from what has abundance and\nsupplies what is wanting, but the dao of man is not thus. It takes from\nwhat is wanting in order to supply what has abundance.\n Who can serve Heaven by means of abundance? Only one who possesses the\nDao.\n Hence the sage acts but relies on nothing. His task accomplished, he does not\ntake the credit: he does not wish to manifest his worth."},{chapter:78,content:"Nothing in the world is more weak and soft than water, yet nothing surpasses\nit in conquering the hard and strong \u2013 there is nothing that can\ncompare.\nAll know that the weak conquers the strong and the soft conquers the hard.\nBut none are able to act on this.\n Thus the sage says that he who receives the derision of the state is the lord of\nthe state altars; he who receives the misfortune of the state is the king\nof the world.\n Straight words seem to reverse themselves."},{chapter:79,content:"When making peace between disputants, there is always some remaining\nsense of dispute \u2013 how can this constitute a good act?\n Therefore, the sage keeps hold of the creditor\u2019s tally but never calls in the\ndebts others owe him.\n One with virtue (de) oversees the tally, one without virtue oversees the\npayment.\n The dao of Tian has no favorites; it always shifts to the good person."},{chapter:80,content:"Make the state small and the people few. Let there be arms for troops in tens\nand hundreds, but unused. Make the people treat death seriously and\nnot move to distant places.\nThough there be boats and carriages, they shall not be ridden.

Encamp an army today \u2014 the campground is all thorns and brambles tomorrow. Make war for a month \u2014 there will be famine for years. Do what needs to be done, but do not rejoice in victory. Make war, if necessary, and win, but without arrogance, without hostility, without pride, without needless violence. War, victory, and the rest do not last. They are contrary to Dao. What is contrary to Dao perishes quickly."},{chapter:31,content:"Weapons generate fear; all creatures hate them. Therefore, the Dao-Master tries not to use them . . . . He uses them only when there is no alternative, and then without joy, in a calm and restrained way. Enjoy weapons, enjoy killing. Enjoy killing, lose yourself . . . . The killing of many people should create sorrow and grief. A great victory is a funeral ceremony."},{chapter:32,content:"The Dao cannot be named or defined. It is invisible, but it contains all things. If rulers could master it, then everything would fall into place. Heaven and Earth would be united. A sweet rain would fall. People would be just without regulation. However, when people seek to rule, they divide the whole and begin assigning names to things. And now, there are names upon names. Too many! The naming must stop. Knowing when to stop saves us from danger. Dao in the world is like rivers flowing into the sea."},{chapter:33,content:"Knowing others is a kind of knowledge; knowing yourself is wisdom. Conquering others requires strength; conquering yourself is true power [De. To realize that you have enough is true wealth. Pushing ahead may succeed, but staying put brings endurance. Die without perishing, and find the eternal."},{chapter:34,content:'The Dao is like an overflowing river. It rises to the left and to the right. The ten thousand things arise from it, but do not depart from it. The Dao acts, but cannot be defined. It clothes and nourishes all beings, but does not rule over them. It endures without desire and without seeming "big." The ten thousand things find their home in it, and yet it does not exercise lordship over them. The Dao is very great, but it does not show its greatness. Therefore, it is truly great.'},{chapter:35,content:"(Text unavailable)"},{chapter:36,content:"To shrink, you must first expand. To weaken, you must first strengthen. To knock down, you must first raise up. To receive, you must first give. This is the way things are. Soft overcomes hard. Slow overcomes fast. Fish cannot live out of the water. A nation's best weapons should not be displayed."},{chapter:37,content:"The Dao never acts, yet through it everything gets done. If rulers could reside in the Dao, everything would fall into place all by itself. Action is restrained by the Dao. Action restrained, no desire. No desire \u2014 tranquility. All things at peace."},{chapter:38,content:"The Dao-Master does not cling to power and is therefore truly powerful. The lesser man clings to power and thus has none. The truly powerful man does nothing and thus leaves nothing undone. The lesser man is awhirl with activity and thus gets nothing accomplished. The virtuous man does what is good as an end in itself. The moral man has a need to do what is good. The man of propriety (li) makes doing good into a ritual, and if people do not follow him willingly, he forces them into line. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises. When virtue is lost, morality arises. When morality is lost, justice arises. When justice is lost, propriety arises. Propriety is merely a shadow of justice, morality, and virtue; it is the beginning of chaos . . . . Therefore, the Dao-Master stays with the Dao. He does not live on the surface of things. He looks to the fruit, not to the flower. He accepts this Dao and rejects that non-Dao."},{chapter:39,content:'In archaic times, by attaining the One, Heaven became clear; Earth became stable; spirit became transcendent; valleys became full; the ten thousand things became alive; rulers made the country ordered and secure. This implies that if Heaven lacked clarity, it would be divided; if the Earth lacked stability, it would be shaky; if spirit lacked transcendence, it would be used up; if valleys lacked fullness, they would be depleted; if the ten thousand things lacked life, they would fade away; and if rulers lacked nobility, they would fall, and the country would collapse into chaos. Therefore, the humble is the root of the noble; the lowly is the foundation of the high. Rulers call themselves "orphans," "widows," and "worthless." This is taking the humble and the lowly as the root and foundation, is it not? You can have all the parts of a chariot without having a chariot. Better to rumble like rocks than to tinkle like jade.'},{chapter:40,content:"Reversal is the motion of the Dao. Yielding is the way of the Dao. All things emerge from being. Being emerges from non-being."},{chapter:41,content:"When a thoughtful man hears of the Dao, he tries to follow it. When an average man hears of the Dao, he wonders about it, but then tends to forget it. When a fool hears of the Dao, he makes fun of it. If someone didn't make fun of it, it wouldn't be the Dao. Therefore, when seeking the Dao, light seems dark, advancing feels like retreating, the simple appears difficult, power is like weakness, purity seems tarnished, true virtue seems deficient and unsteady, and the clear seems obscure. The true square has no corners. The true vessel never sails. The true sound is hard to hear. The true form has no shape. The Dao is hidden, beyond definition; but it alone fulfills."},{chapter:42,content:'Out of Dao, One. Out of One, Two. Out of Two, Three. Out of Three, all things. All things carry Yin and face Yang. Out of the union of Yin and Yang, harmony. No one wants to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "unworthy." But kings and princes use these words as titles for themselves. You win by losing. You lose by winning. It has been said, and I agree, "A violent man dies violently."'},{chapter:43,content:"The softest thing overcomes the hardest thing.

Loss or gain \u2014 which is worse? Attachment to things brings suffering. Much hoarded, much to be lost. Know when enough is enough. Avoid disgrace. Know when to stop. Avoid danger. This is how to endure."},{chapter:45,content:"The perfect seems flawed, but its usefulness is unlimited. Full seems empty, but it is inexhaustible. Straight seems bent. Intelligent seems stupid. Eloquent seems tongue-tied. Motion defeats the cold. Stillness defeats the heat.

When the kingdom departs from the Dao, warhorses are bred in the land. There is no greater curse than wanting more than enough. There is no greater sin than greed. He who knows when enough is enough always has enough."},{chapter:47,content:"You can know the whole world without going out the door; you can know the Way of Heaven without looking out the window. The further afield you go, the less you know. The Dao-Master knows without going out; understands without looking; achieves without ado."},{chapter:48,content:"Pursue learning, gain daily. Follow the Dao, lose daily. By losing day-by-day, you arrive at non-ado. Nothing done, nothing left undone. Master the world by letting things be, by letting them take their own course.

He is good to people who are good. He is also good to people who aren't good. This is true goodness. He trusts people who are trustworthy. He also trusts people who aren't trustworthy. This is true trust. The Dao-Master radiates peace and harmony. Through him, the hearts of the people are made one. Are the people his children, or is he their child?"},{chapter:50,content:"Come into life, go into death. Three out of ten have a lust for life. Three out of ten have a lust for death. Three out of ten just pass from birth to death without appreciating either life or death. Why is this? Because none of them appreciates both life and death. But there are those [one out of ten? who appreciate both life and death. When they travel the country, they are not attacked by rhinos and tigers. When they go into battle, they are not wounded. The rhino finds nothing to gore. The tiger finds nothing to claw. Weapons find nothing to pierce. Why? Because such people have gone beyond death."},{chapter:51,content:"Dao gives birth to the ten thousand things. De nurtures them. They are formed from matter and completed by environment. Therefore, the ten thousand things honor Dao and respect De, not in response to commandments, but just naturally. Dao gives birth to the ten thousand things, and De nurtures, rears, develops, shelters, and protects them. But Dao and De do not try to own or rule the ten thousand things, nor do they seek to make them dependent. This is true power."},{chapter:52,content:"The world's Source, the Mother of all things. Knowing the Mother, we know her children. Knowing the children, but holding on to the Mother, we are free from the fear of death. Stop talking, withdraw from the rat-race, and life is full. Blab on, lose yourself in busy-ness, and life is lost. Seeing the small requires good vision. Yielding is strength. Turn to the Inner Light, and find the eternal."},{chapter:53,content:"If I had any sense, I would walk on the main road [the Dao, and I would fear leaving it. Keeping to the main road [the Dao is so easy, and yet people love to stray from it as they seek shortcuts. Look!

Some are beautifully dressed and bejeweled, wearing flashy weapons on their belts, eating and drinking until they burst.

He can cry all day, but he does not lose his voice, because he exists in harmony with the totality of being. Existing in harmony, he is in the eternity of the Dao. Being in the Dao, he finds wisdom. He sees no point in breath-control or mind-control techniques aimed at prolonging his life. Trying to live on and on is contrary to the Dao. To live contrary to the Dao is to die."},{chapter:56,content:"Those who know do not tell. Those who tell do not know. Stop talking, withdraw from the rat-race, calm your spirit, untangle yourself, soften your glare. Be one with the dust of the earth. This is primal union. Achieving union with the Dao places one beyond attraction and repulsion, benefit and harm, honor and disgrace. This is the highest state of being."},{chapter:57,content:'In governing, employ no surprises. In waging war, employ only surprises. Win the world with non-ado. How do I know this? Like this! The more rules and regulations there are, the poorer the people become. The more experts there are, the more confusion there is. The more skillful and clever technicians there are, the more horrifying inventions are produced. The more "law and order" there is, the higher the crime-rate. Therefore, the Dao-Master says, "I do nothing, and the people govern themselves. I practice keeping quiet, and the people find justice. I seek emptiness, and the people prosper. I have no desires, and the people return to a natural and simple life."'},{chapter:58,content:"When the government is restrained, the people are happy and satisfied. When the government meddles in everything, the people are disgruntled and miserable. Happiness eclipses misery. Misery eclipses happiness. Which will it be? The straight becomes crooked. Good becomes evil. The people remain bewildered. Thus, the Dao-Master is sharp but not cutting, incisive but not biting, straight but not controlling, bright but not glaring."},{chapter:59,content:"In governing the country and serving Heaven, show restraint. Showing restraint is submission to the Dao. Submission to the Dao will fill you with De. Being filled with De, there will be no limit to your power, and there will be nothing you cannot overcome. When there is nothing you cannot overcome, you will be a true ruler indeed. You will be one with the country. You will be the Mother of the country. Being the Mother of the country, you will have deep roots and a firm base. Your reign will be long-lasting. This is the Dao of long life and eternal vision."},{chapter:60,content:"Rule a large country as you would cook a small fish. Follow the Dao, and evil will be subdued. Evil will still be there, but it won't be able to do much harm. The Dao-Master does no harm. If no harm is done, then the power of the Dao can flow on."},{chapter:61,content:". A great country is like a sea into which all streams flow, the Female of the world. The Female overcomes the Male with stillness. The woman overcomes the man by lying underneath him. Therefore, a great country dominates a small country by submitting to it; and a small country can dominate a great country by submitting to it. Yield and conquer. A great country wants to unite and shelter people. A small country wants to come in and be sheltered. Each gets what it wants. Thus, the great country should yield."},{chapter:62,content:"The Dao is the source of all things, the good man's treasure, the bad man's refuge. You can buy beautiful words. You can build your reputation with good deeds. But even bad people can use beautiful words and perform good deeds. So when the new emperor is crowned (and the three ministers of state are installed), do not send gifts of jade and fourhorse chariots. Instead, be still, and offer the Dao. The ancients treasured the Dao because, when you seek it, you find it. Through the Dao, even sinners receive forgiveness. That is why everybody loves the Dao."},{chapter:63,content:"Act without ado; work without effort. Taste the tasteless; treat the small as large and the few as many. Reward evil with goodness. Take on the difficult while it is still easy, the large while it is still small. Difficult always begins as easy; large always begins as small. Therefore, the Dao-Master never tries to be great. As a result, he accomplishes great things. Big promises produce little trust. Treating something as quite easy makes it very difficult. The Dao-Master regards everything as difficult, which means that, for him, everything is easy."},{chapter:64,content:"That which is lying still is easy to pick up. That which has not yet happened is easy to prevent. That which is brittle is easily shattered. That which is small is easily scattered. Deal with things before they become problems. Straighten things out before they become confused. A huge tree begins as a tiny sprout. A terrace nine storeys high begins as a small pile of dirt. The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout. A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step. Intrude and ruin. Grasp and lose. Therefore, the Dao-Master practices non-ado and so does not ruin; he is not grasping and so does not lose. People often fail just when they are about to succeed. Be as careful at the end as you are at the beginning, and you will not fail. Therefore, the Dao-Master desires no-desire, treasures no treasures, studies no studies. He pays attention to what others have ignored. He helps all things find their center, all without ado."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancient rulers who followed the Dao did not try to enlighten the people, but rather aimed at making them dull. People are hard to govern because they are so clever. Rulers who seek to enlighten the people are like bandits who prey upon the land. Rulers who forget about enlightening the people are a real blessing to the nation. Remember these two enduring principles. They represent the power [De of the Dao. De goes deep and far. All things turn back and reach original harmony."},{chapter:66,content:"Great rivers and seas are kings to hundreds of lesser streams because they lie lower than the lesser streams. To stand above, you must speak from below. To lead, you must follow behind. This is how the ruler who follows the Dao stands above and leads the people. And in this way, the people are neither overburdened nor oppressed. The whole nation supports such a ruler. He contends with no one, and no one contends with him."},{chapter:67,content:"Many consider my teaching to be nonsense. But the profound is a lot like nonsense. If a teaching does not seem nonsensical, then it must be trivial. I have three treasures to guard and preserve: The first is compassion. The second is self-restraint. The third is not wanting to be ahead of others. Compassion breeds fortitude. Self-restraint breeds generosity. Not wanting to be ahead of others breeds leadership. These days, people want courage without compassion, generosity without self-restraint, and leadership without the willingness to be led. This is death. Compassion rules! On the attack, it wins. On the defense, it holds the fort. It is Heaven's means of aid and protection."},{chapter:68,content:"The best soldier does not rush into battle. The best fighter does not display his anger. The best conqueror does not take vengeance on his enemy. The best leader is the best follower. This is known as the power [De of not contending. This is known as true leadership. This is known as following Heaven's lead."},{chapter:69,content:'There is a saying among military strategists: "Instead of advancing, I\'ll be advanced upon; it is better to retreat a foot than to advance an inch." This is known as advancing without advancing, getting ready without showing your muscles, capturing without attacking, being well-armed without weapons. There is nothing worse than underestimating your enemy. That leads to total defeat. Therefore, when armies clash, it is the side that does not rejoice in war-making that wins.'},{chapter:70,content:"My teachings are very easy to understand and even easier to put into practice. And yet, no one understands or practices them. My teachings are derived from an ancient system of principles. People who do not realize this do not really know me. Few know me, but that is my value. Therefore, the Dao-Master wears rough clothing, but has a jewel for a heart."},{chapter:71,content:"To know that you do not know is strength. Not knowing that you do not know is a sickness. The cure begins with the recognition of the sickness. The Dao-Master is not sick, but he is sick of sickness. Thus, he is well."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people do not fear your power, then your power has become truly great. Do not intrude into their homes. Do not interfere with their work. If you do not oppress them, then they will not become sick of you. Thus, the Dao-Master knows himself, but does not show himself. He loves himself, but is not arrogant. Therefore, he lets go of that and chooses this."},{chapter:73,content:"A man of daring courage will kill or be killed. A man of cautious courage seeks to save lives. Each of these may be either beneficial or harmful. Heaven hates what it hates. Who knows why? Even the Dao-Master can't figure it out. The Dao does not contend, but it prevails. It does not speak, but it answers. It is not called, but it responds. It has no purpose, but it achieves all of its aims. Heaven's net is wide; nothing slips through."},{chapter:74,content:"If people do not fear death, then you cannot threaten them with it. If they are afraid of death, we could make death the penalty for breaking the law. But do we dare to do so? Consider the role of the official executioner: Are you ready to play that role? When amateurs try to play the master carpenter, they usually cut and bruise themselves in the process."},{chapter:75,content:"When taxes are too high, people starve. When the government is too intrusive, it makes life no longer worth living and the people lose their love of life and their fear of death. To promote the value of life, do not interfere with it."},{chapter:76,content:"People are born soft and flexible; when they are dead, they are hard and stiff. Living plants are tender and pliant; when they are dead, they are brittle and dried out. Therefore, whatever is hard and stiff is a sign of death. Whatever is soft and flexible is a sign of life. An army without flexibility never wins. An unbending tree is easily brought down by the wind. The hard and stiff fall. The soft and flexible rise."},{chapter:77,content:"The Dao is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. If the cord is too long, it is shortened; if it is too short, it is lengthened. The policy of the Dao is to take from those who have too much and give to those who have too little. But that is not the human practice. We take from those who have too little and give to those who have too much. Who is it that has more than enough and gives his surplus to those in need? Only the follower of the Dao. The follower of the Dao acts without hope of gain, accomplishes but takes no credit, does not wish to lord it over others."},{chapter:78,content:"Water is soft and yielding, but nothing can more effectively dissolve the hard and inflexible. Weak defeats strong. Soft defeats hard. This is well-known, but not easy to put into practice. Therefore, the Dao-Master says: He who takes upon himself the dirt of the nation becomes the master of its sacred soil; he who takes upon himself the evils of the land becomes a true king under Heaven. Straight words seem crooked."},{chapter:79,content:"Great resentment, even when appeased, does not go away. How can this be good? Therefore, the Dao-Master keeps his promises, but he does not look into whether others are keeping theirs. The man of virtue (De) monitors himself; the man without virtue monitors others. The Dao of Heaven plays no favorites, but it is always manifest in the good man"},{chapter:80,content:"Imagine a small country with a small population. They have lots of technology, but they use none of it. They take the prospect of death seriously and thus do not travel far from home. They have boats and carriages, but no one takes them out. They have weapons and armor, but no one takes them out of the armory. Instead of writing, they have gone back to the old system of cord-knotting. They enjoy their plain but good food, their simple but fine clothing, their humble but secure homes. They are happy with their way of life. The next country is so close that the crowing of the cocks and the barking of the dogs over there can be easily heard over here; and yet the people over here grow old and die without ever having been over there."},{chapter:81,content:"True words aren't pretty; pretty words aren't true. The good do not contend; those who contend aren't good. The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise. The Dao-Master is not greedy. The more he does for others, the more he has.

away;\nIf the spirit lacked transcendence it would be exhausted;\nIf the valley lacked fullness it would be depleted;\nIf the myriad things lacked life they would vanish.\nIf the ruler lacks nobility

when you are sick of being sick\nCan you be cured.\nThe sage's not being sick\nIs because she is sick of sickness.\nTherefore she is not sick."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people do not fear your might\nThen your might has truly become great.\nDon't interfere with their household affairs.\nDon't oppress their livelihood.\nIf you don't oppress them they won't feel oppressed.\nThus the sage

will die.\nIf you are courageous in not-daring you will live.\nAmong these two, one is beneficial and the other is harmful.\nWho understands the reason why Heaven dislikes what it dislikes?\nEven the

death they are hard and stiff.\nWhen plants are alive they are soft and delicate.\nWhen they die, they wither and dry up.\nTherefore the hard and stiff are followers of death.\nThe gentle and soft are the followers of life.\nThus, if you are aggressive and stiff, you won't win.\nWhen a tree is hard enough, it is cut.

substance can enter where there is no room.\nHence I know the value of non-action.\nTeaching without words and working without doing\nAre understood by very few."},{chapter:44,content:"Fame or self: Which matters more?\nSelf or wealth: Which is more precious?\nGain or loss: Which causes more pain?\nThose who are attached to things will suffer greatly.\nThose who save will suffer heavy losses.\nThose who are contented are never disappointed.\nThose who know when to stop do not find themselves in trouble.\nThey remain forever safe."},{chapter:45,content:"Great accomplishment seems

horses haul manure.\nWhen the Tao is absent from the universe,\nWar horses are bred outside the city.\nThere is no greater sin than craving,\nNo greater curse than discontent,\nNo greater misfortune than wanting something for ourselves.\nTherefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough."},{chapter:47,content:"Without going outside, you may know the whole world.\nWithout looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.\nThe farther you go, the less you know.\nThus the wise know without traveling;\nSee without looking;\nWork without doing."},{chapter:48,content:"In the pursuit of learning, something is acquired every day.\nIn the pursuit of the Tao, every day something is relinquished.\nLess and less is done\nUntil non-action is achieved.\nWhen nothing is done, nothing is left undone.\nThe world is governed by letting things take their course.\nIt cannot be governed through interference."},{chapter:49,content:"The wise do not

people look to them and listen."},{chapter:50,content:"Between birth and death,\nThree in ten are followers of life,\nThree in ten are followers of death,\nAnd people just passing from birth to death
