Those highest in propriety take action And if people don't reciprocate Roll up their sleeves and throw them out.\nTherefore Lose Tao And Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence And righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows.\nPropriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in.\nAnd so the ideal person dwells In substance, not dilution, In reality, not glory, Accepts one, rejects the other."},{chapter:39,content:"Of old, these attained the One: Heaven attaining the One Became clear.

Therefore, When the fighting gets hot, Those who grieve will conquer."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand, Very easy to practice.

One brings profit, one brings harm.\nOf these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by heaven. Who knows why?

If it's not enough, Add on to it: Heaven's Tao.\nThe Human Route Is not like this, Depriving the poor, Offering to the rich. Who has a surplus And still offers it to the world?

People ponder on death And don't travel far.\nThey have carriages and boats, But no one goes on board; Weapons and armour, But no one brandishes them.\nThey use knotted cords for counting.

broad, reaching left as well as right.\nThe myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority.\nIt accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit.\nIt clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master.\n\nFor ever free of desire, it can be called small;\nYet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called

to you and meeting with no harm\nIt will be safe and sound.\nMusic and food\nWill induce the wayfarer to stop.\n\nThe way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt

act."},{chapter:48,content:"In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day;\nIn the pursuit of the way one does less every day.\nOne does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one does nothing at all there is nothing that is undone.\n\nIt is always through not meddling that the empire is won.\nShould you meddle, then you are not equal to the task of winning the empire."},{chapter:49,content:"The sage has no mind of his own.\nHe takes as his own the mind of the people.\n\nThose who are good I treat as good.\nThose who are not good I also treat as good.\nIn so doing I gain in goodness.\nThose who are of good faith I have faith in.\nThose who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in.\nIn so doing I gain in good faith.\n\nThe sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it.\nThe people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children."},{chapter:50,content:"When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so? Because they set too much store by life.\nI have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.\nThere is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;\nThere is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;\nThere is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.\nWhy is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death."},{chapter:51,content:"The way gives them life;\nVirtue rears them;\nThings give them shape;\nCircumstances bring them to maturity.\n\nTherefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.\nYet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\n\nThus the way gives them life and rears them;\nBrings them up and nurses them;\nBrings them to fruition and maturity;\nFeeds and shelters them.\n\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue."},{chapter:52,content:"The world had a beginning\nAnd this beginning could be the mother of the world.\nWhen you know the mother\nGo on to know the child.\nAfter you have known the child\nGo back to holding fast to the mother,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.\n\nBlock the openings,\nShut the doors,\nAnd all your life you will not run dry.\nUnblock the openings,\nAdd to your troubles,\nAnd to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.\n\nTo see the small is called discernment;\nTo hold fast to the submissive is called strength.\nUse the light\nBut give up the discernment.\nBring not misfortune upon yourself.\n\nThis is known as following the constant."},{chapter:53,content:"Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.\nThe great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.\n\nThe court is corrupt,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty;\nYet there are those dressed in fineries,\nWith swords at their sides,\nFilled with food and drink,\nAnd possessed of too much wealth.\nThis is known as taking the lead in robbery.\n\nFar indeed is this from the way."},{chapter:54,content:"What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out;\nWhat is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose;\nThrough this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end.\n\nCultivate it in your person\nAnd its virtue will be genuine;\nCultivate it in the family\nAnd its virtue will be more than sufficient;\nCultivate it in the hamlet\nAnd its virtue will endure;\nCultivate it in the state\nAnd its virtue will abound;\nCultivate it in the empire\nAnd its virtue will be pervasive.\n\nHence look at the person through the person;\nLook at the family through the family;\nLook at the hamlet through the hamlet;\nLook at the state through the state;\nLook at the empire through the empire.\n\nHow do I know that the empire is like that?\nBy means of this."},{chapter:55,content:"One who possesses virtue in abundance is comparable to a new born babe:\nPoisonous insects will not sting it;\nFerocious animals will not pounce on it;\nPredatory birds will not swoop down on it.\nIts bones are weak and its sinews supple yet its hold is firm.\nIt does not know the union of male and female yet its male member will stir:\nThis is because its virility is at its height.\nIt howls all day yet does not become hoarse:\nThis is because its harmony is at its height.\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called discernment.\nTo try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened;\nFor the mind to egg on the breath is called violent.\n\nA creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.\nThat which goes against the way will come to an early

wheels move only along old ruts.\n\nThis is known as mysterious sameness.\n\nHence you cannot get close to it, nor can you keep it at arm's length;\nYou cannot bestow benefit on it, nor can you do it harm;\nYou cannot ennoble it, nor can you debase it.\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire."},{chapter:57,content:"Govern the state by being straightforward;\nWage war by being crafty;\nBut win the empire by not being meddlesome.\n\nHow do I know that it is like that?\nBy means of this.\n\nThe more taboos there are in the empire\nThe poorer the people;\nThe more sharpened tools the people have\nThe more benighted the state;\nThe more skills the people have\nThe further novelties multiply;\nThe better known the laws and edicts\nThe more thieves and robbers there are.\n\nHence the sage says,\nI take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;\nI prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;\nI am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;\nI am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block."},{chapter:58,content:"When the government is muddled\nThe people are simple;\nWhen the government is alert\nThe people are cunning.\n\nIt is on disaster that good fortune perches;\nIt is beneath good fortune that disaster crouches.\n\nWho knows the limit? Does not the straightforward exist?\nThe straighforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changes again into the monstrous.\nIndeed, it is long since the people were perplexed.\n\nTherefore the sage is square-edged but does not scrape,\nHas corners but does not jab,\nExtends himself but not at the expense of others,\nShines but does not dazzle."},{chapter:59,content:"In ruling the people and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler to be sparing.\nIt is because he is sparing\nThat he may be said to follow the way from the start;\nFollowing the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue;\nAccumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;\nWhen there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit;\nWhen no one knows his limit\nHe can possess a state;\nWhen he possesses the mother of a state\nHe can then endure.\nThis is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one lives to see many days."},{chapter:60,content:"Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.\n\nWhen the empire is ruled in accordance with the way,\nThe spirits lose their potencies.\nOr rather, it is not that they lose their potencies,\nBut that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people.\nIt is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people,\nThe sage, also, does not harm the people.\nAs neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other."},{chapter:61,content:"A large state is the lower reaches of a river:\nThe place where all the streams of the world unite.\n\nIn the union of the world,\nThe female always gets the better of the male by stillness.\n\nBeing still, she takes the lower position.\n\nHence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state;\nThe small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state.\n\nThus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;\nThe other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.\nAll that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;\nAll that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other.\nIf each of the two wants to find its proper place,\nIt is meet that the large should take the lower position."},{chapter:62,content:"The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.\nIt is that by which the good man protects,\nAnd that by which the bad is protected.\n\nBeautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;\nBeautiful deeds can raise a man above others.\n\nEven if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?\n\nHence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.\nWhy was this way valued of old?\nWas it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed?\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire."},{chapter:63,content:"Do that which consists in taking no action;\nPursue that which is not meddlesome;\nSavor that which has no flavor.\n\nMake the small big and the few many;\nDo good to him who has done you an injury.\n\nLay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult;\nMake something big by starting with it when small.\n\nDifficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in the easy;\nBig things must needs have their beginnings in the small.\n\nTherefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great.\n\nOne who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;\nOne who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\nThat is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him."},{chapter:64,content:"It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;\nIt is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop;\nIt is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle;\nIt is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.\n\nDeal with a thing while it is still nothing;\nKeep a thing in order before disorder sets in.\n\nA tree that can fill the span of a man's arms\nGrows from a downy tip;\nA terrace nine storeys high\nRises from hodfuls of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles\nStarts from beneath one's feet.\n\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nWhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\n\nTherefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything;\nAnd, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing.\n\nIn their enterprises the people\nAlways ruin them when on the verge of success.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning\nAnd there will be no ruined enterprises.\n\nTherefore the sage desires not to desire\nAnd does not value goods which are hard to come by;\nLearns to be without learning\nAnd makes good the mistakes of the multitude\nIn order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act."},{chapter:65,content:"Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.\nThe reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.\n\nHence to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be to the detriment of the state;\nNot to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be a boon to the state.\nThese two are models.\nAlways to know the models\nIs known as mysterious virtue.\nMysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,\nBut when things turn back it turns back with them.\n\nOnly then is complete conformity realized."},{chapter:66,content:"The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundred valleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.\nHence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.\n\nTherefore, desiring to rule over the people,\nOne must in one's words humble oneself before them;\nAnd, desiring to lead the people,\nOne must, in one's person, follow behind them.\n\nTherefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden;\ntakes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.\nThat is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doing so.\n\nIt is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.\nIt is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.\nIf it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.\n\nI have three treasures\nWhich I hold and cherish.\nThe first is known as compassion,\nThe second is known as frugality,\nThe third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;\nBeing compassionate one could afford to be courageous,\nBeing frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,\nNot daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lord over the vessels.\n\nNow, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion, to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.\n\nThrough compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable in defence.\nWhat heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion."},{chapter:68,content:"One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;\nOne who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;\nOne who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;\nOne who excels in employing others humbles himself before them.\n\nThis is known as the virtue of non-contention;\nThis is known as making use of the efforts of others;\nThis is known as matching the sublimity of heaven."},{chapter:69,content:"The strategists have a saying,\nI dare not play the host but play the guest,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.\n\nThis is known as marching forward when there is no road,\nRolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm,\nDragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary,\nAnd taking up arms when there are no arms.\n\nThere is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily.\nSo doing nearly cost me my treasure.\nThus of two sides raising arms against each other,\nIt is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,\nYet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.\n\nWords have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.\n\nIt is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me.\nThose who understand me are few;\nThose who harm me are honoured.\n\nTherefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person a priceless piece of jade."},{chapter:71,content:"To know yet to think that one does not know is best;\nNot to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.\n\nIt is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it.\nThe sage meets with no difficulty.\nIt is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitation will descend upon them.\n\nDo not constrict their living space;\nDo not press down on their means of livelihood.\nIt is because you do not press down on them that they will not weary of the burden.\n\nHence the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other."},{chapter:73,content:"He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death;\nHe who is fearless in being timid will stay alive.\nOf the two, one leads to good, the other to harm.\n\nHeaven hates what it hates,\nWho knows the reason why?\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\n\nThe way of heaven\nExcels in overcoming though it does not contend,\nIn responding though it does not speak,\nIn attracting though it does not summon,\nIn laying plans though it appears slack.\n\nThe net of heaven is cast wide.\nThough the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through."},{chapter:74,content:"When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with death?\nWere the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put to death those who innovate, then who would dare?\nThere is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.\nTo kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter.\nIn chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who escape hurting their own hands instead."},{chapter:75,content:"The people are hungry:\nIt is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes\nThat the people are hungry.\nThe people are difficult to govern.\nIt is because those in authority are too fond of action\nThat the people are difficult to govern.\nThe people treat death lightly:\nIt is because the people set too much store by life\nThat they treat death lightly.\n\nIt is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than the man who values life."},{chapter:76,content:"A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead.\nGrass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelled when dead.\nThus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death;\nThe supple and the weak are the comrades of life.\n\nTherefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish;\nA tree that is strong will suffer the axe.\nThe strong and big takes the lower position,\nThe supple and weak takes the higher position."},{chapter:77,content:"Is not the way of heaven like the stretching of a bow?\nThe high it presses down,\nThe low it lifts up;\nThe excessive it takes from,\nThe deficient it gives to.\n\nIt is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order to make good what is deficient.\nThe way of man is otherwise: it takes from those who are in want in order to offer this to those who already have more than enough.\nWho is there that can take what he himself has in excess and offer this to the empire?\nOnly he who has the way.\n\nTherefore the sage benefits them yet exacts no gratitude,\nAccomplishes his task yet lays claim to no merit.\n\nIs this not because he does not wish to be considered a better man than others?"},{chapter:78,content:"In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water.\nYet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.\nThis is because there is nothing that can take its place.\n\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nAnd the submissive overcomes the hard,\nEveryone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge into practice.\n\nTherefore the sage says,\nOne who takes on himself the humiliation of the state\nIs called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet.\nOne who takes on himself the calamity of the state\nIs called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire.\n\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When peace is made between great enemies,\nSome enmity is bound to remain undispelled.\nHow can this be considered perfect?\n\nTherefore the sage takes the left-hand tally, but exacts no payment from the people.\nThe man of virtue takes charge of the tally;\nThe man of no virtue takes charge of exaction.\n\nIt is the way of heaven to show no favoritism.\nIt is for ever on the side of the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"Reduce the size of the population and the state.\nEnsure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop or a battalion they will not use them;\nAnd also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places because they look on death as no light matter.\n\nEven when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them;\nAnd even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to make a show of them.\n\nBring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope,\nWill find relish in their food\nAnd beauty in their clothes,\nWill be content in their abode\nAnd happy in the way they live.\n\nThough adjoining states are within sight of one another,\nAnd the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another,\nyet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another."},{chapter:81,content:"Truthful words are not beautiful;\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nGood words are not persuasive;\nPersuasive words are not good.\nHe who knows has no wide learning;\nHe who has wide learning does not know.\n\nThe sage does not hoard.\nHaving bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more;\nHaving given all he has to others, he is richer still.\n\nThe

left;\nGood omens belong on the left\nBad omens belong on the right;\nAnd warriors press to the right!\nWhen the general stands at the right\nHis lieutenant is placed at the left.\nSo the usage of men

real.\nLow virtue makes one miss no chance\nTo show his virtue off;\nHis virtue then is naught.\nHigh virtue is at rest;\nIt knows no need to act.\nLow virtue is a busyness\nPretending to accomplishment.\n\nCompassion at its best\nConsists in honest deeds;\nMorality at best\nIs something done, aforethought;\nHigh etiquette, when acted out\nWithout response from others,\nConstrains a man to bare his arms\nAnd make them do their duty!\n\nTruly, once the Way is lost,\nThere comes then virtue;\nVirtue lost, comes then compassion;\nAfter that morality;\nAnd when that's lost, there's

full-grown, a man will take\nThe meat and not the husk,\nThe fruit and not the flower.\nRejecting one, he takes the other."},{chapter:39,content:'These things in ancient times received the One:\n\nThe sky obtained it and was clarified;\nThe earth received it and was settled firm;\nThe spirits got it and were energized;\nThe valleys had it, filled to overflow;\nAll things, as they partook it came alive;\nThe nobles and the king imbibed the One\nIn order that the realm might upright be;\nSuch things were then accomplished by the One.\n\nWithout its clarity the sky might break;\nExcept it were

vulgar people, when they hear the news,\nWill laugh out loud, and if they did not laugh,\nIt would not be the Way.\n\nAnd so there is a proverb:\n"When going looks like coming back,\nThe clearest road is mighty dark."\n\nToday, the Way that\'s plain looks rough,\nAnd lofty virtue like a chasm;\nThe purest innocence like shame,\nThe broadest power not enough,\nEstablished goodness knavery,\nSubstantial worth like shifting tides.\nGreat space has no corners;\nGreat powers come late;\nGreat music is soft sound;\nThe great Form no shape.\n\nThe Way is obscure and unnamed;\nIt is a skilled investor, nonetheless,\nThe master of accomplishment.'},{chapter:42,content:"The Way begot one,\nAnd the one, two;\nThen the two begot three\nAnd three, all else.\n\nAll things bear the shade on their backs\nAnd the sun in their arms;\nBy the blending of breath\nFrom the sun and the shade,\nEquilibrium comes to the world.\n\nOrphaned, or needy, or desolate, these\nAre conditions much

seeing,\nDoes without doing."},{chapter:48,content:"The student learns by daily increment.\nThe Way is gained by daily loss,\nLoss upon loss until\nAt last comes rest.\n\nBy letting go, it all gets

so?\nBy this:\n\nAs taboos increase, people grow poorer;\nWhen weapons abound, the state grows chaotic;\nWhere skills multiply, novelties flourish;\nAs statutes increase, more criminals start.\n\nSo

God,\nThere\'s nothing else like stores saved up."\n\nBy "stores saved up" is meant forehandedness,\nAccumulate Virtue, such that nothing\nCan resist it and its limit\nNone can guess: such infinite resource\nAllows the jurisdiction of the king;\nWhose kingdom then will long endure\nIf it provides the Mother an abode.\nIndeed it is the deeply rooted base,\nThe firm foundation of the Way\nTo

them.\n\nSince then the Wise Man and the people\nHarm each other not at all,\nTheir several virtues should converge."},{chapter:61,content:"The great land is a place\nTo which the streams descend;\nIt is the concourse and\nThe female of the world:\nQuiescent, underneath,\nIt overcomes the male.\n\nBy quietness and by humility\nThe great land then puts down the small\nAnd gets it for its own;\nBut small lands too absorb the great\nBy their subservience.\nThus some lie low, designing conquest's ends;\nWhile others lowly are, by nature bent\nTo conquer all the rest.\n\nThe great land's foremost need is to increase\nThe number of its folk;\nThe small land needs above all else to find\nIts folk more room to work.\nThat both be served and each attain its goal\nThe great land should attempt humility."},{chapter:62,content:"Like the gods of the shrine in the home,\nSo the Way and its mystery waits\nIn the world of material things:\nThe good man's treasure,\nThe bad man's refuge.\n\nFair wordage is ever for sale;\nFair manners are worn like a cloak;\nBut why should there be such waste\nOf the badness in men?\n\nOn the day of the emperor's crowning,\nWhen the three noble dukes are

that sinners who find are forgiven?\nSo did they lift up the Way and its Virtue\nAbove everything else in the world."},{chapter:63,content:"Act in repose;\nBe at rest when you work;\nRelish unflavored things.\nGreat or small,\nFrequent or rare,\nRequite anger with virtue.\n\nTake hard jobs in hand\nWhile they are easy;\nAnd great affairs too\nWhile they are small.\nThe troubles of the world\nCannot be solved except\nBefore they grow too hard.\nThe business of the world\nCannot be done except\nWhile relatively small.\nThe Wise Man, then, throughout his life\nDoes nothing great and yet achieves\nA

take care is before it is done.\nEstablish order before confusion sets in.\nTree trunks around which you can reach with\n\nyour arms were at first only minuscule sprouts.\nA nine-storied terrace began with a clod.\nA thousand-mile journey began with a foot put down.\n\nDoing spoils it, grabbing misses it;\nSo the Wise Man refrains from doing\n\nand doesn't spoil anything;\nHe grabs at nothing so never misses.\n\nPeople are constantly spoiling a project\nwhen it lacks only a step to completion.\nTo avoid making a mess of it,\nbe as careful of the end as you were of the beginning.\nSo the Wise Man wants the unwanted;\nhe sets no high value on anything\nbecause it is hard to get.\nHe studies what others neglect\nand restores to the world what multitudes have passed by.\nHis object is to restore everything to its natural course,\nbut he dares take no steps to that end."},{chapter:65,content:"Those ancients who were skilled in the Way\nDid not enlighten people by their rule\nBut had them ever held in ignorance:\nThe more the folk know what is going on\nThe harder it becomes to govern them.\n\nFor public knowledge of the government\nIs such a thief that it will spoil the realm;\nBut when good fortune brings good times to all\nThe land is ruled without publicity.\nTo know the difference between these two\nInvolves a standard to be sought and found.\n\nTo know that standard always, everywhere,\nIs mystic Virtue, justly known as such;\nWhich Virtue is so deep and reaching far,\nIt causes a return, things go back\nTo that prime concord which at first all shared."},{chapter:66,content:"How could the rivers and the seas\nBecome like kings to valleys?\nBecause of skill in lowliness\nThey have become the valley's lords.\n\nSo then to be above the folk,\nYou speak as if you were beneath;\nAnd if you wish to be out front,\nThen act as if you were behind.\n\nThe Wise Man so is up above\nBut is no burden to the folk;\nHis station is ahead of them\nTo see they do not come to harm.\n\nThe world will gladly help along\nThe Wise Man and will bear no grudge.\nSince he contends not for his own\nThe world will not contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"Everywhere, they say the Way, our doctrine,\nIs so very like detested folly;\nBut greatness of its own alone explains\nWhy it should be thus held beyond the pale.\nIf it were only orthodox, long since\nIt would have seemed a small and petty thing!\n\nI have to keep three treasures well secured:\nThe first, compassion; next, frugality;\nAnd third, I say that never

Rather abide\nAt the center of your being;\nFor the more you leave it, the less you learn.\nSearch your heart and see\nIf he is wise who takes each turn:\nThe way to do is to be."},{chapter:47,content:"A man anxious for knowledge adds more to himself every minute;\nA man acquiring life loses himself in it,\nHas less and less to bear in mind,\nLess and less to do,\nBecause life, he finds, is well inclined,\nIncluding himself too.\nOften a man sways the world like a wind\nBut not by deed;\nAnd if there appear to you to be need\nOf motion to sway it, it has left you behind."},{chapter:48,content:"A sound man's heart is not shut within itself\nBut is open to other people's hearts:\nI find good people good,\nAnd I find bad people good\nIf l am good enough;\nI trust men of their word,\nAnd I trust liars\nIf I am true enough;\nI feel the heart-heats of others\nAbove my own\nIf I am enough of a father,\nEnough of a son."},{chapter:49,content:"Death might appear to be the issue of life,\nSince for every three out of ten being born\nThree out of ten are dying.\nThen why\nShould another three out of ten continue breeding death?\nBy use of sheer madness to multiply.\nBut there is one out of ten, they say, so sure of life\nThat tiger and wild bull keep clear of his inland path.\nWeapons turn from him on the battle-field,\nNo bull-horn could tell where to gore him,\nNo tiger-claw where to tear him,\nNo weapon where to enter him.\nAnd why?\nBecause he has no death to die."},{chapter:50,content:"The source of life\nIs as a mother.\nBe fond of both mother and children but know the mother dearer\nAnd you outlive death.\nCurb your tongue and senses\nAnd you are beyond trouble,\nLet them loose\nAnd you are beyond help.\nDiscover that nothing is too small for clear vision,\nToo insignificant for tender strength~\nUse outlook\nAnd insight,\nUse them both\nAnd you are immune:\nFor you have witnessed eternity."},{chapter:51,content:"If I had any learning\nOf a highway wide and fit,\nWould I lose it at each turning?\nYet look at people spurning\nNatural use of it!\nSee how fine the palaces\nAnd see how poor the farms,\nHow bare the peasants' granaries\nWhile gentry wear embroideries\nHiding sharpened arms,\nAnd the more they have the more they seize,\nHow can there be such men as these\nWho never hunger, never thirst,\nYet eat and drink until they burst!\nThere are other brigands, but these are the worst\nOf all the highway's harms."},{chapter:52,content:"'Since true foundation cannot fail\nBut holds as good as new,\nMany a worshipful son shall hail\nA father who lived true.'\nRealized in one man, fitness has its rise;\nRealized in a family, fitness multiplies;\nRealized in a village, fitness gathers weight;\nRealized in a country, fitness becomes great;\nRealized in the world, fitness fills the skies.\nAnd thus the fitness of one man\nYou find in the family he began,\nYou find in the village that accrued,\nYou find in the country that ensued,\nYou find in the world's whole multitude.\nHow do I know this integrity?\nBecause it could all begin in me."},{chapter:53,content:"He whom life fulfills,\nThough he remains a child,\nIs immune to the poisonous sting\nOf insects, to the ravening\nOf wild beasts or to vultures' bills.\nHe needs no more bone or muscle than a baby's for sure hold.\nWithout thought of joined organs, he is gender\nWhich grows firm, unfaltering.\nThough his voice should cry out at full pitch all day, it would not rasp but would stay tender\nThrough the perfect balancing\nOf a man at endless ease with everything\nBecause of the true life that he has led.\nTo try for more than this bodes ill.\nIt is said, 'there's a way where there's a will;'\nBut let life ripen and then fall.\nWillis not the way at all:\nDeny the way of life and you are dead."},{chapter:54,content:"Those who know do not tell,\nThose who tell do not know.\nNot to set the tongue loose\nBut to curb it,\nNot to have edges that catch\nBut to remain untangled,\nUnblinded,\nUnconfused,\nIs to find balance,\nAnd he who holds baiance beyond sway of love or hate,\nBeyond reach of profit or loss,\nBeyond care of praise or blame,\nHas attained the highest post in the world."},{chapter:55,content:"A realm is governed by ordinary acts,\nA battle is governed by extraordinary acts;\nThe world is governed by no acts at all.\nAnd how do I know?\nThis is how I know.\nAct after act prohibits\nEverything but poverty,\nWeapon after weapon conquers\nEverything but chaos,\nBusiness after business provides\nA craze of waste,\nLaw after law breeds\nA multitude of thieves.\nTherefore a sensible man says:\nIf I keep from meddling with people, they take care of themselves,\nIf I keep from commanding people, they behave themselves,\nIf I keep from preaching at people, they improve themselves,\nIf I keep from imposing on people, they become themselves."},{chapter:56,content:"The less a leader does and says\nThe happier his people,\nThe more a leader struts and brags\nThe sorrier his people.\nOften what appears to be unhappiness is happiness\nAnd what appears to be happiness is unhappiness.\nWho can see what leads to what\nWhen happiness appears and yet is not,\nWhen what should he is nothing but a mask\nDisguising what should not be? Who can but ask\nAn end to such a stupid plot!\nTherefore a sound man shall so square the circle\nAnd circle the square as not to injure, not to impede:\nThe glow of his life shall not daze,\nIt shall lead."},{chapter:57,content:"To lead men and serve heaven, weigh the worth\nOf the one source:\nUse the single force\nWhich doubles the strength of the strong\nBy enabling man to go right, disabling him to go wrong,\nBe so charged with the nature of life that you give your people birth,\nThat you mother your land, are the fit\nAnd ever-iving root of it:\nThe seeing.root, whose eye is infinite."},{chapter:58,content:"Handle a large kingdom with as gentle a touch as if you were cooking small fish.\nIf you manage people by letting them alone,\nGhosts of the dead shall not haunt you.\nNot that there are no ghosts\nBut that their influence becomes propitious\nIn the sound existence of a living man:\nThere is no difference between the quick and the dead,\nThey are one channel of vitality."},{chapter:59,content:"A large country is the low level of interflowing rivers.\nIt draws people to the sea-end of a valley\nAs the female draws the male,\nReceives it into absorbing depth\nBecause depth always absorbs.\nAnd so a large country, inasfar as it is deeper than a small country,\nAbsorbs the small-\nOr a small country, inasfar as it is deeper than a large country,\nAbsorbs the large.\nSome countnes consciously seek depth into which to draw others.\nSome countries naturally have depth into which to draw others:\nA large country needs to admit,\nA small country needs to emit,\nAnd so each country can naturally have what it needs\nIf the large country submit."},{chapter:60,content:"Existence is sanctuary:\nIt is a good man's purse,\nIt is also a bad man's keep.\nClever performances come dear or cheap,\nGoodness comes free;\nAnd how shall a man who acts better deny a man who acts worse\nThis right to be.\nRather, when an emperor is crowned, let the three\nMinisters whom he appoints to receive for him fine horses and gifts of jade\nReceive for him also the motionless gift of integrity,\nThe gift prized as highest by those ancients who said,\n'Only pursue an offender to show him the way.'\nWhat men in all the world could have more wealth than\nthey?"},{chapter:61,content:"Men knowing the way of life\nDo without acting,\nEffect without enforcing,\nTaste without consuming;\n'Through the many they find the few,\nThrough the humble the great;'\nThey 'respect their foes,'\nThey 'face the simple fact before it becomes involved,\nSolve the small problem before it becomes big.'\nThe most involved fact in the world\nCould have been faced when it was simple,\nThe biggest problem in the world\nCould have been solved when it was small.\nThe simple fact that he finds no problem big\nIs a sane man's prime achievement.\nIf you say yes too quickly\nYou may have to say no,\nIf you think things are done too easily\nYou may find them hard to do:\nIf you face trouble sanely\nIt cannot trouble you."},{chapter:62,content:"Before it move, hold it,\nBefore it go wrong, mould it,\nDrain off water in winter before it freeze,\nBefore weeds grow, sow them to the breeze.\nYou can deal with what has not happened, can foresee\nHarmful events and not allow them to be.\nThough-- as naturally as a seed becomes a tree of arm-wide girth-\nThere can rise a nine-tiered tower from a man's handful of earth\nOr here at your feet a thousand-mile journey have birth,\nQuick action bruises,\nQuick grasping loses.\nTherefore a sane man's care is not to exert\nOne move that can miss, one move that can hurt.\nMost people who miss, after almost winning,\nShould have 'known the end from the beginning.'\nA sane man is sane in knowing what things he can spare,\nIn not wishing what most people wish,\nIn not reaching for things that seem rare.\nThe cultured might call him heathenish,\nThis man of few words, because his one care\nIs not to interfere but to let nature renew\nThe sense of direction men undo."},{chapter:63,content:"Sound old rulers, it is said,\nLeft people to themselves, instead\nOf wanting to teach everything\nAnd start the people arguing.\nWith mere instruction in command,\nSo that people understand\nLess than they know, woe is the land;\nBut happy the land that is ordered so\nThat they understand more than they know.\nFor everyone's good this double key\nLocks and unlocks equally.\nIf modern man would use it, he\nCould find old wisdom in his heart\nAnd clear his vision enough to see\nFrom start to finish and finish to start\nThe circle rounding perfectly."},{chapter:64,content:"Why are rivers and seas lords of the waters?\nBecause they afford the common level\nAnd so become lords of the waters.\nThe common people love a sound man\nBecause he does not talk above their level,\nBecause, though he lead them,\nHe follows them,\nHe imposes no weight on them;\nAnd they in turn, because he does not impede them,\nYield to him, content:\nPeople never tire of anyone\nWho is not bent upon comparison."},{chapter:65,content:"Everyone says that my way of life is the way of a simpleton.\nBeing largely the way of a simpleton is what makes it worth while.\nIf it were not the way of a simpleton\nIt would long ago have been worthless,\nThese possessions of a simpleton being the three I\nchoose\nAnd cherish:\nTo care,\nTo be fair,\nTo be humble.\nWhen a man cares he is unafraid\nWhen he is fair he leaves enough for others,\nWhen he is humble he can grow;\nWhereas if, like men of today, he be bold without caring,\nSelf-indulgent without sharing,\nSelf-important without shame,\nHe is dead.\nThe invincible shield\nOf caring\nIs a weapon from the sky\nAgainst being dead."},{chapter:66,content:"The best captain does not plunge headlong\nNor is the best soldier a fellow hot to fight.\nThe greatest victor wins without a battle:\nHe who overcomes men understands them.\nThere is a quality of quietness\nWhich quickens people by no stress:\n'fellowship with heaven,' as of old,\nIs fellowship with man and keeps its hold."},{chapter:67,content:"The handbook of the strategist has said:\n'Do not invite the fight, accept it instead,'\n'Better a foot behind than an inch too far ahead,'\nWhich means:\nLook a man straight in the face and make no move,\nRoll up your sleeve and clench no fist,\nOpen your hand and show no weapon,\nBare your breast and find no foe.\nBut as long as there be a foe, value him,\nRespect him, measure him, be humble toward him;\nLet him not strip from you, however strong he be,\nCompassion, the one wealth which can afford him."},{chapter:68,content:"My way is so simple to feel, so easy to apply,\nThat only a few will feel it or apply it.\nIf it were not the lasting way, the natural way to try,\nIf it were a passing way, everyone would try it.\nBut however few shall go my way\nOr feel concerned with me,\nSome there are and those are they\nWho witness what they see:\nSanity is a haircloth sheath\nWith a jewel underneath."},{chapter:69,content:"A man who knows how little he knows is well,\nA man who knows how much he knows is sick.\nIf, when you see the symptoms, you can tell,\nYour cure is quick.\nA sound man knows that sickness makes him sick\nAnd before he catches it his cure is quick."},{chapter:70,content:"Upon those who defy authority\nIt shall be visited,\nBut not behind prison walls\nNor through oppression of their kin;\nMen sanely led\nAre not led by duress.\nTo know yourself and not show yourself,\nTo think well of yourself and not tell of yourself,\nBe that your no and your yes."},{chapter:71,content:"A man with outward courage dares to die,\nA man with inward courage dares to live;\nBut either of these men\nHas a better and a worse side than the other.\nAnd who can tell exactly to which qualities heaven objects?\nHeaven does nothing to win the day,\nSays nothing-Is echoed,\nOrders nothing-Is obeyed,\nAdvises nothing-Is right:\nAnd which of us, seeing that nothing is outside the vast\nWide-meshed net of heaven, knows just how it is cast?"},{chapter:72,content:"People starve\nIf taxes eat their grain,\nAnd the faults of starving people\nAre the fault of their rulers.\nThat is why people rebel.\nMen who have to fight for their living\nAnd are not afraid to die for it\nAre higher men than those who, stationed high,\nAre too fat to dare to die."},{chapter:73,content:"Death is no threat to people\nWho are not afraid to die;\nBut even if these offenders feared death all day,\nWho should be rash enough\nTo act as executioner?\nNature is executioner.\nWhen man usurps the place,\nA carpenter's apprentice takes the place of the master:\nAnd 'an apprentice hacking with the master's axe\nMay slice his own hand.'"},{chapter:74,content:"Man, born tender and yielding,\nStiffens and hardens in death.\nAll living growth is pliant,\nUntil death transfixes it.\nThus men who have hardened are 'kin of death'\nAnd men who stay gentle are 'kin of life.'\nThus a hard-hearted army is doomed to lose.\nA tree hard-fleshed is cut down:\nDown goes the tough and big,\nUp comes the tender sprig."},{chapter:75,content:"Is not existence\nLike a drawn bow?\nThe ends approach,\nThe height shortens, the narrowness widens.\nTrue living would take from those with too much\nEnough for those with too little,\nWhereas man exacts from those with too little\nStill more for those with too much.\nNow what man shall have wealth enough to share with all men\nSave one who can freely draw from the common means?\nA sane man needs no better support, no richer reward,\nThan this common means,\nThrough which he is all men's equal."},{chapter:76,content:"What is more fluid, more yielding than water?\nYet back it comes again, wearing down the rigid strength\nWhich cannot yield to withstand it.\nSo it is that the strong are overcome by the weak,\nThe haughty by the humble.\nThis we know\nBut never learn,\nSo that when wise men tell us,\n'He who bites the dust\nIs owner of the earth,\nHe who is scapegoat\nIs king,'\nThey seem to twist the truth."},{chapter:77,content:"If terms to end a quarrel leave bad feeling,\nWhat good are they?\nSo a sensible man takes the poor end of the bargain\nWithout quibbling.\nIt is sensible to make terms,\nFoolish to be a stickler:\nThough heaven prefer no man,\nA sensible man prefers heaven."},{chapter:78,content:"If a land is small and its people are few,\nWith tenfold enough to have and to do,\nAnd if no one has schooled them to waste supply\nIn the country for which they live and would die,\nThen not a boat, not a cart\nTempts this people to depart,\nNot a dagger, not a bow\nHas to be drawn or bent for show,\nPeople reckon by knots in a cord,\nRelish plain food on the board,\nSimple clothing suits them well,\nAnd they remain content to dwell\nIn homes their customs can afford.\nThough so close to their own town another town grow\nThey can hear its dogs bark and its roosters crow,\nYet glad of life in the village they know,\nWhere else in the world shall they need to go?"},{chapter:79,content:"Real words are not vain,\nVain words not real;\nAnd since those who argue prove nothing\nA sensible man does not argue.\nA sensible man is wiser than he knows,\nWhile a fool knows more than is wise.\nTherefore a sensible man does not devise resources:\nThe greater his use to others\nThe greater their use to him,\nThe more he yields to others\nThe more they yield to him.\nThe way of life cleaves without cutting:\nWhich, without need to say,\nShould be man's way."}]}],It=function(e){var
