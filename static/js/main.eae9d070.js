This world has no need for weapons, Which soon turn on themselves.\nWhere armies camp, nettles grow. After each war, years of famine.\nThe most fruitful outcome Does not depend on force,\nBut succeeds without arrogance Without hostility Without Pride Without resistance Without violence.\nIf these things prosper and grow old, This is called not-Tao.

In war, honor the right.\nGood omens honour the left. Bad omens honour the right.

To the left To the right.\nAll beings owe their life to it And do not depart from it. It acts without a name. It clothes and nourishes all beings But does not become their master.\nEnduring without desires, It may be called slight.\nAll beings return to it, But it does not become their master. It may be called immense.\nBy not making itself great, It can do great things."},{chapter:35,content:"Hold the great elephant - The great image - And the world moves.

A country's sharpest weapons Cannot be displayed."},{chapter:37,content:"Tao endures without a name, Yet nothing is left undone.\nIf kings and lords could possess it, All beings would transform themselves. Transformed, they desire to create; I quiet them through nameless simplicity. Then there is no desire.\nNo desire is serenity, An the world settles of itself."},{chapter:38,content:"High Te? No Te! That's what Te is. Low Te doesn't lack Te; That's what Te is not.\nThose highest in Te take no action And don't need to act.

Those highest in propriety take action And if people don't reciprocate Roll up their sleeves and throw them out.\nTherefore Lose Tao And Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence And righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows.\nPropriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in.\nAnd so the ideal person dwells In substance, not dilution, In reality, not glory, Accepts one, rejects the other."},{chapter:39,content:"Of old, these attained the One: Heaven attaining the One Became clear. Earth attaining the One Became stable. Spirits attaining the One Became sacred.\nValleys attaining the One Became bountiful. Myriad beings attaining the One Became fertile.

Death is only the thirteen body parts. Human life, moving towards death, Is the same thirteen. Why is this? Because life gives life to substance.\nYou have heard of people Good at holding on to life.

to you and meeting with no harm\nIt will be safe and sound.\nMusic and food\nWill induce the wayfarer to stop.\n\nThe way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor.\nIt cannot be seen,\nIt

act."},{chapter:48,content:"In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day;\nIn the pursuit of the way one does less every day.\nOne does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one does nothing at all there is nothing that is undone.\n\nIt is always through not meddling that the empire is won.\nShould you meddle, then you are not equal to the task of winning the empire."},{chapter:49,content:"The sage has no mind of his own.\nHe takes as his own the mind of the people.\n\nThose who are good I treat as good.\nThose who are not good I also treat as good.\nIn so doing I gain in goodness.\nThose who are of good faith I have faith in.\nThose who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in.\nIn so doing I gain in good faith.\n\nThe sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it.\nThe people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children."},{chapter:50,content:"When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten.\nWhy is this so? Because they set too much store by life.\nI have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army.\nThere is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn;\nThere is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws;\nThere is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade.\nWhy is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death."},{chapter:51,content:"The way gives them life;\nVirtue rears them;\nThings give them shape;\nCircumstances bring them to maturity.\n\nTherefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue.\nYet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\n\nThus the way gives them life and rears them;\nBrings them up and nurses them;\nBrings them to fruition and maturity;\nFeeds and shelters them.\n\nIt gives them life yet claims no possession;\nIt benefits them yet exacts no gratitude;\nIt is the steward yet exercises no authority.\nSuch is called the mysterious virtue."},{chapter:52,content:"The world had a beginning\nAnd this beginning could be the mother of the world.\nWhen you know the mother\nGo on to know the child.\nAfter you have known the child\nGo back to holding fast to the mother,\nAnd to the end of your days you will not meet with danger.\n\nBlock the openings,\nShut the doors,\nAnd all your life you will not run dry.\nUnblock the openings,\nAdd to your troubles,\nAnd to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation.\n\nTo see the small is called discernment;\nTo hold fast to the submissive is called strength.\nUse the light\nBut give up the discernment.\nBring not misfortune upon yourself.\n\nThis is known as following the constant."},{chapter:53,content:"Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray.\nThe great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths.\n\nThe court is corrupt,\nThe fields are overgrown with weeds,\nThe granaries are empty;\nYet there are those dressed in fineries,\nWith swords at their sides,\nFilled with food and drink,\nAnd possessed of too much wealth.\nThis is known as taking the lead in robbery.\n\nFar indeed is this from the way."},{chapter:54,content:"What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out;\nWhat is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose;\nThrough this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end.\n\nCultivate it in your person\nAnd its virtue will be genuine;\nCultivate it in the family\nAnd its virtue will be more than sufficient;\nCultivate it in the hamlet\nAnd its virtue will endure;\nCultivate it in the state\nAnd its virtue will abound;\nCultivate it in the empire\nAnd its virtue will be pervasive.\n\nHence look at the person through the person;\nLook at the family through the family;\nLook at the hamlet through the hamlet;\nLook at the state through the state;\nLook at the empire through the empire.\n\nHow do I know that the empire is like that?\nBy means of this."},{chapter:55,content:"One who possesses virtue in abundance is comparable to a new born babe:\nPoisonous insects will not sting it;\nFerocious animals will not pounce on it;\nPredatory birds will not swoop down on it.\nIts bones are weak and its sinews supple yet its hold is firm.\nIt does not know the union of male and female yet its male member will stir:\nThis is because its virility is at its height.\nIt howls all day yet does not become hoarse:\nThis is because its harmony is at its height.\nTo know harmony is called the constant;\nTo know the constant is called discernment.\nTo try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened;\nFor the mind to egg on the breath is called violent.\n\nA creature in its prime doing harm to the old\nIs known as going against the way.\nThat which goes against the way will come to an early

wheels move only along old ruts.\n\nThis is known as mysterious sameness.\n\nHence you cannot get close to it, nor can you keep it at arm's length;\nYou cannot bestow benefit on it, nor can you do it harm;\nYou cannot ennoble it, nor can you debase it.\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire."},{chapter:57,content:"Govern the state by being straightforward;\nWage war by being crafty;\nBut win the empire by not being meddlesome.\n\nHow do I know that it is like that?\nBy means of this.\n\nThe more taboos there are in the empire\nThe poorer the people;\nThe more sharpened tools the people have\nThe more benighted the state;\nThe more skills the people have\nThe further novelties multiply;\nThe better known the laws and edicts\nThe more thieves and robbers there are.\n\nHence the sage says,\nI take no action and the people are transformed of themselves;\nI prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves;\nI am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves;\nI am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block."},{chapter:58,content:"When the government is muddled\nThe people are simple;\nWhen the government is alert\nThe people are cunning.\n\nIt is on disaster that good fortune perches;\nIt is beneath good fortune that disaster crouches.\n\nWho knows the limit? Does not the straightforward exist?\nThe straighforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changes again into the monstrous.\nIndeed, it is long since the people were perplexed.\n\nTherefore the sage is square-edged but does not scrape,\nHas corners but does not jab,\nExtends himself but not at the expense of others,\nShines but does not dazzle."},{chapter:59,content:"In ruling the people and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler to be sparing.\nIt is because he is sparing\nThat he may be said to follow the way from the start;\nFollowing the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue;\nAccumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome;\nWhen there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit;\nWhen no one knows his limit\nHe can possess a state;\nWhen he possesses the mother of a state\nHe can then endure.\nThis is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one lives to see many days."},{chapter:60,content:"Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish.\n\nWhen the empire is ruled in accordance with the way,\nThe spirits lose their potencies.\nOr rather, it is not that they lose their potencies,\nBut that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people.\nIt is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people,\nThe sage, also, does not harm the people.\nAs neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other."},{chapter:61,content:"A large state is the lower reaches of a river:\nThe place where all the streams of the world unite.\n\nIn the union of the world,\nThe female always gets the better of the male by stillness.\n\nBeing still, she takes the lower position.\n\nHence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state;\nThe small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state.\n\nThus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes;\nThe other, by taking the lower position, is annexed.\nAll that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing;\nAll that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other.\nIf each of the two wants to find its proper place,\nIt is meet that the large should take the lower position."},{chapter:62,content:"The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures.\nIt is that by which the good man protects,\nAnd that by which the bad is protected.\n\nBeautiful words when offered will win high rank in return;\nBeautiful deeds can raise a man above others.\n\nEven if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned?\n\nHence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses.\nWhy was this way valued of old?\nWas it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed?\n\nTherefore it is valued by the empire."},{chapter:63,content:"Do that which consists in taking no action;\nPursue that which is not meddlesome;\nSavor that which has no flavor.\n\nMake the small big and the few many;\nDo good to him who has done you an injury.\n\nLay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult;\nMake something big by starting with it when small.\n\nDifficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in the easy;\nBig things must needs have their beginnings in the small.\n\nTherefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great.\n\nOne who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith;\nOne who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties.\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\nThat is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him."},{chapter:64,content:"It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure;\nIt is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop;\nIt is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle;\nIt is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute.\n\nDeal with a thing while it is still nothing;\nKeep a thing in order before disorder sets in.\n\nA tree that can fill the span of a man's arms\nGrows from a downy tip;\nA terrace nine storeys high\nRises from hodfuls of earth;\nA journey of a thousand miles\nStarts from beneath one's feet.\n\nWhoever does anything to it will ruin it;\nWhoever lays hold of it will lose it.\n\nTherefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything;\nAnd, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing.\n\nIn their enterprises the people\nAlways ruin them when on the verge of success.\nBe as careful at the end as at the beginning\nAnd there will be no ruined enterprises.\n\nTherefore the sage desires not to desire\nAnd does not value goods which are hard to come by;\nLearns to be without learning\nAnd makes good the mistakes of the multitude\nIn order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act."},{chapter:65,content:"Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them.\nThe reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever.\n\nHence to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be to the detriment of the state;\nNot to rule a state by cleverness\nWill be a boon to the state.\nThese two are models.\nAlways to know the models\nIs known as mysterious virtue.\nMysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching,\nBut when things turn back it turns back with them.\n\nOnly then is complete conformity realized."},{chapter:66,content:"The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundred valleys is that they excel in taking the lower position.\nHence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys.\n\nTherefore, desiring to rule over the people,\nOne must in one's words humble oneself before them;\nAnd, desiring to lead the people,\nOne must, in one's person, follow behind them.\n\nTherefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden;\ntakes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction.\nThat is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doing so.\n\nIt is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing.\nIt is because it is vast that it resembles nothing.\nIf it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small.\n\nI have three treasures\nWhich I hold and cherish.\nThe first is known as compassion,\nThe second is known as frugality,\nThe third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire;\nBeing compassionate one could afford to be courageous,\nBeing frugal one could afford to extend one's territory,\nNot daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lord over the vessels.\n\nNow, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion, to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death.\n\nThrough compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable in defence.\nWhat heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion."},{chapter:68,content:"One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable;\nOne who excels in fighting is never roused in anger;\nOne who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue;\nOne who excels in employing others humbles himself before them.\n\nThis is known as the virtue of non-contention;\nThis is known as making use of the efforts of others;\nThis is known as matching the sublimity of heaven."},{chapter:69,content:"The strategists have a saying,\nI dare not play the host but play the guest,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead.\n\nThis is known as marching forward when there is no road,\nRolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm,\nDragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary,\nAnd taking up arms when there are no arms.\n\nThere is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily.\nSo doing nearly cost me my treasure.\nThus of two sides raising arms against each other,\nIt is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins."},{chapter:70,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice,\nYet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice.\n\nWords have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign.\n\nIt is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me.\nThose who understand me are few;\nThose who harm me are honoured.\n\nTherefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person a priceless piece of jade."},{chapter:71,content:"To know yet to think that one does not know is best;\nNot to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.\n\nIt is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it.\nThe sage meets with no difficulty.\nIt is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty."},{chapter:72,content:"When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitation will descend upon them.\n\nDo not constrict their living space;\nDo not press down on their means of livelihood.\nIt is because you do not press down on them that they will not weary of the burden.\n\nHence the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nTherefore he discards the one and takes the other."},{chapter:73,content:"He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death;\nHe who is fearless in being timid will stay alive.\nOf the two, one leads to good, the other to harm.\n\nHeaven hates what it hates,\nWho knows the reason why?\n\nTherefore even the sage treats some things as difficult.\n\nThe way of heaven\nExcels in overcoming though it does not contend,\nIn responding though it does not speak,\nIn attracting though it does not summon,\nIn laying plans though it appears slack.\n\nThe net of heaven is cast wide.\nThough the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through."},{chapter:74,content:"When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with death?\nWere the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put to death those who innovate, then who would dare?\nThere is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill.\nTo kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter.\nIn chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who escape hurting their own hands instead."},{chapter:75,content:"The people are hungry:\nIt is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes\nThat the people are hungry.\nThe people are difficult to govern.\nIt is because those in authority are too fond of action\nThat the people are difficult to govern.\nThe people treat death lightly:\nIt is because the people set too much store by life\nThat they treat death lightly.\n\nIt is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than the man who values life."},{chapter:76,content:"A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead.\nGrass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelled when dead.\nThus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death;\nThe supple and the weak are the comrades of life.\n\nTherefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish;\nA tree that is strong will suffer the axe.\nThe strong and big takes the lower position,\nThe supple and weak takes the higher position."},{chapter:77,content:"Is not the way of heaven like the stretching of a bow?\nThe high it presses down,\nThe low it lifts up;\nThe excessive it takes from,\nThe deficient it gives to.\n\nIt is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order to make good what is deficient.\nThe way of man is otherwise: it takes from those who are in want in order to offer this to those who already have more than enough.\nWho is there that can take what he himself has in excess and offer this to the empire?\nOnly he who has the way.\n\nTherefore the sage benefits them yet exacts no gratitude,\nAccomplishes his task yet lays claim to no merit.\n\nIs this not because he does not wish to be considered a better man than others?"},{chapter:78,content:"In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water.\nYet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.\nThis is because there is nothing that can take its place.\n\nThat the weak overcomes the strong,\nAnd the submissive overcomes the hard,\nEveryone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge into practice.\n\nTherefore the sage says,\nOne who takes on himself the humiliation of the state\nIs called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet.\nOne who takes on himself the calamity of the state\nIs called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire.\n\nStraightforward words seem paradoxical."},{chapter:79,content:"When peace is made between great enemies,\nSome enmity is bound to remain undispelled.\nHow can this be considered perfect?\n\nTherefore the sage takes the left-hand tally, but exacts no payment from the people.\nThe man of virtue takes charge of the tally;\nThe man of no virtue takes charge of exaction.\n\nIt is the way of heaven to show no favoritism.\nIt is for ever on the side of the good man."},{chapter:80,content:"Reduce the size of the population and the state.\nEnsure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop or a battalion they will not use them;\nAnd also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places because they look on death as no light matter.\n\nEven when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them;\nAnd even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to make a show of them.\n\nBring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope,\nWill find relish in their food\nAnd beauty in their clothes,\nWill be content in their abode\nAnd happy in the way they live.\n\nThough adjoining states are within sight of one another,\nAnd the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another,\nyet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another."},{chapter:81,content:"Truthful words are not beautiful;\nBeautiful words are not truthful.\nGood words are not persuasive;\nPersuasive words are not good.\nHe who knows has no wide learning;\nHe who has wide learning does not know.\n\nThe sage does not hoard.\nHaving bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more;\nHaving given all he has to others, he is richer still.\n\nThe

left;\nGood omens belong on the left\nBad omens belong on the right;\nAnd warriors press to the right!\nWhen the general stands at the right\nHis lieutenant is placed at the left.\nSo the usage of men

real.\nLow virtue makes one miss no chance\nTo show his virtue off;\nHis virtue then is naught.\nHigh virtue is at rest;\nIt knows no need to act.\nLow virtue is a busyness\nPretending to accomplishment.\n\nCompassion at its best\nConsists in honest deeds;\nMorality at best\nIs something done, aforethought;\nHigh etiquette, when acted out\nWithout response from others,\nConstrains a man to bare his arms\nAnd make them do their duty!\n\nTruly, once the Way is lost,\nThere comes then virtue;\nVirtue lost, comes then compassion;\nAfter that morality;\nAnd when that's lost, there's

full-grown, a man will take\nThe meat and not the husk,\nThe fruit and not the flower.\nRejecting one, he takes the other."},{chapter:39,content:'These things in ancient times received the One:\n\nThe sky obtained it and was clarified;\nThe earth received it and was settled firm;\nThe spirits got it and were energized;\nThe valleys had it, filled to overflow;\nAll things, as they partook it came alive;\nThe nobles and the king imbibed the One\nIn order that the realm might upright be;\nSuch things were then accomplished by the One.\n\nWithout its clarity the sky might break;\nExcept it were

vulgar people, when they hear the news,\nWill laugh out loud, and if they did not laugh,\nIt would not be the Way.\n\nAnd so there is a proverb:\n"When going looks like coming back,\nThe clearest road is mighty dark."\n\nToday, the Way that\'s plain looks rough,\nAnd lofty virtue like a chasm;\nThe purest innocence like shame,\nThe broadest power not enough,\nEstablished goodness knavery,\nSubstantial worth like shifting tides.\nGreat space has no corners;\nGreat powers come late;\nGreat music is soft sound;\nThe great Form no shape.\n\nThe Way is obscure and unnamed;\nIt is a skilled investor, nonetheless,\nThe master of accomplishment.'},{chapter:42,content:"The Way begot one,\nAnd the one, two;\nThen the two begot three\nAnd three, all else.\n\nAll things bear the shade on their backs\nAnd the sun in their arms;\nBy the blending of breath\nFrom the sun and the shade,\nEquilibrium comes to the world.\n\nOrphaned, or needy, or desolate, these\nAre conditions much

seeing,\nDoes without doing."},{chapter:48,content:"The student learns by daily increment.\nThe Way is gained by daily loss,\nLoss upon loss until\nAt last comes rest.\n\nBy letting go, it all gets

so?\nBy this:\n\nAs taboos increase, people grow poorer;\nWhen weapons abound, the state grows chaotic;\nWhere skills multiply, novelties flourish;\nAs statutes increase, more criminals start.\n\nSo

God,\nThere\'s nothing else like stores saved up."\n\nBy "stores saved up" is meant forehandedness,\nAccumulate Virtue, such that nothing\nCan resist it and its limit\nNone can guess: such infinite resource\nAllows the jurisdiction of the king;\nWhose kingdom then will long endure\nIf it provides the Mother an abode.\nIndeed it is the deeply rooted base,\nThe firm foundation of the Way\nTo

them.\n\nSince then the Wise Man and the people\nHarm each other not at all,\nTheir several virtues should converge."},{chapter:61,content:"The great land is a place\nTo which the streams descend;\nIt is the concourse and\nThe female of the world:\nQuiescent, underneath,\nIt overcomes the male.\n\nBy quietness and by humility\nThe great land then puts down the small\nAnd gets it for its own;\nBut small lands too absorb the great\nBy their subservience.\nThus some lie low, designing conquest's ends;\nWhile others lowly are, by nature bent\nTo conquer all the rest.\n\nThe great land's foremost need is to increase\nThe number of its folk;\nThe small land needs above all else to find\nIts folk more room to work.\nThat both be served and each attain its goal\nThe great land should attempt humility."},{chapter:62,content:"Like the gods of the shrine in the home,\nSo the Way and its mystery waits\nIn the world of material things:\nThe good man's treasure,\nThe bad man's refuge.\n\nFair wordage is ever for sale;\nFair manners are worn like a cloak;\nBut why should there be such waste\nOf the badness in men?\n\nOn the day of the emperor's crowning,\nWhen the three noble dukes are

that sinners who find are forgiven?\nSo did they lift up the Way and its Virtue\nAbove everything else in the world."},{chapter:63,content:"Act in repose;\nBe at rest when you work;\nRelish unflavored things.\nGreat or small,\nFrequent or rare,\nRequite anger with virtue.\n\nTake hard jobs in hand\nWhile they are easy;\nAnd great affairs too\nWhile they are small.\nThe troubles of the world\nCannot be solved except\nBefore they grow too hard.\nThe business of the world\nCannot be done except\nWhile relatively small.\nThe Wise Man, then, throughout his life\nDoes nothing great and yet achieves\nA

take care is before it is done.\nEstablish order before confusion sets in.\nTree trunks around which you can reach with\n\nyour arms were at first only minuscule sprouts.\nA nine-storied terrace began with a clod.\nA thousand-mile journey began with a foot put down.\n\nDoing spoils it, grabbing misses it;\nSo the Wise Man refrains from doing\n\nand doesn't spoil anything;\nHe grabs at nothing so never misses.\n\nPeople are constantly spoiling a project\nwhen it lacks only a step to completion.\nTo avoid making a mess of it,\nbe as careful of the end as you were of the beginning.\nSo the Wise Man wants the unwanted;\nhe sets no high value on anything\nbecause it is hard to get.\nHe studies what others neglect\nand restores to the world what multitudes have passed by.\nHis object is to restore everything to its natural course,\nbut he dares take no steps to that end."},{chapter:65,content:"Those ancients who were skilled in the Way\nDid not enlighten people by their rule\nBut had them ever held in ignorance:\nThe more the folk know what is going on\nThe harder it becomes to govern them.\n\nFor public knowledge of the government\nIs such a thief that it will spoil the realm;\nBut when good fortune brings good times to all\nThe land is ruled without publicity.\nTo know the difference between these two\nInvolves a standard to be sought and found.\n\nTo know that standard always, everywhere,\nIs mystic Virtue, justly known as such;\nWhich Virtue is so deep and reaching far,\nIt causes a return, things go back\nTo that prime concord which at first all shared."},{chapter:66,content:"How could the rivers and the seas\nBecome like kings to valleys?\nBecause of skill in lowliness\nThey have become the valley's lords.\n\nSo then to be above the folk,\nYou speak as if you were beneath;\nAnd if you wish to be out front,\nThen act as if you were behind.\n\nThe Wise Man so is up above\nBut is no burden to the folk;\nHis station is ahead of them\nTo see they do not come to harm.\n\nThe world will gladly help along\nThe Wise Man and will bear no grudge.\nSince he contends not for his own\nThe world will not contend with him."},{chapter:67,content:"Everywhere, they say the Way, our doctrine,\nIs so very like detested folly;\nBut greatness of its own alone explains\nWhy it should be thus held beyond the pale.\nIf it were only orthodox, long since\nIt would have seemed a small and petty thing!\n\nI have to keep three treasures well secured:\nThe first, compassion; next, frugality;\nAnd third, I say that never

be the issue of life,\nSince for every three out of ten being born\nThree out of ten are dying.\nThen why\nShould another three out of ten continue breeding death?\nBy use of sheer madness to multiply.\nBut there is one out of ten, they say, so sure of life\nThat tiger and wild bull keep clear of his inland path.\nWeapons turn from him on the battle-field,\nNo bull-horn could tell where to gore him,\nNo tiger-claw where to tear him,\nNo weapon where to enter him.\nAnd why?\nBecause he has no death to die."},{chapter:50,content:"The source of life\nIs as a mother.\nBe fond of both mother

for clear vision,\nToo insignificant for tender strength~\nUse outlook\nAnd insight,\nUse them both\nAnd you are immune:\nFor you have witnessed eternity."},{chapter:51,content:"If I had any learning\nOf a highway wide and fit,\nWould I lose it at each turning?\nYet look at people spurning\nNatural use of it!\nSee how fine the palaces\nAnd see how poor the farms,\nHow bare the peasants' granaries\nWhile gentry wear embroideries\nHiding sharpened arms,\nAnd the more they have the more they seize,\nHow can there be such men as these\nWho never hunger, never thirst,\nYet eat and drink until they burst!\nThere are other brigands, but these are the worst\nOf all the highway's harms."},{chapter:52,content:"'Since true foundation cannot fail\nBut holds as good as new,\nMany a

of vitality."},{chapter:59,content:"A large country is the low level of interflowing rivers.\nIt draws people to the sea-end of a valley\nAs the female draws the male,\nReceives it into absorbing depth\nBecause depth always absorbs.\nAnd so a large country, inasfar as it is deeper than a small country,\nAbsorbs the small-\nOr a small country, inasfar as it is deeper than a large

involved,\nSolve the small problem before it becomes big.'\nThe most involved fact in the world\nCould have been faced when it was simple,\nThe biggest problem in the world\nCould have been solved

may find them hard to do:\nIf you face trouble sanely\nIt cannot trouble you."},{chapter:62,content:"Before it move, hold it,\nBefore it go wrong, mould it,\nDrain off water in winter before it

arm-wide girth-\nThere can rise a nine-tiered tower from a man's handful of earth\nOr here at your feet a thousand-mile journey have birth,\nQuick action bruises,\nQuick grasping loses.\nTherefore a sane man's care is not to exert\nOne move that can miss, one move that can hurt.\nMost people who miss, after almost winning,\nShould have 'known the end from the beginning.'\nA sane man is sane in knowing what things he can spare,\nIn not wishing what most people wish,\nIn not reaching for things that seem rare.\nThe cultured might call him heathenish,\nThis man of few words, because his one care\nIs not to interfere but to let nature renew\nThe sense of direction men undo."},{chapter:63,content:"Sound old rulers, it is said,\nLeft people to themselves, instead\nOf wanting to teach everything\nAnd start the people arguing.\nWith mere instruction in command,\nSo that people understand\nLess than they know, woe is the land;\nBut happy the land that is ordered so\nThat they

sleeve and clench no fist,\nOpen your hand and show no weapon,\nBare your breast and find no foe.\nBut as long as there be a foe, value him,\nRespect him, measure him, be humble toward him;\nLet him

who defy authority\nIt shall be visited,\nBut not behind prison walls\nNor through oppression of their kin;\nMen sanely led\nAre not led by duress.\nTo know yourself and not show yourself,\nTo think well of yourself and not tell of yourself,\nBe that your no and your yes."},{chapter:71,content:"A man with outward courage dares to die,\nA man with inward courage dares to live;\nBut either of these

tender sprig."},{chapter:75,content:"Is not existence\nLike a drawn bow?\nThe ends approach,\nThe height shortens, the narrowness widens.\nTrue living would take from those with too much\nEnough for those with too little,\nWhereas man exacts from those with too little\nStill more for those with too much.\nNow what man shall have wealth enough to share with all men\nSave one who can freely draw from the common means?\nA sane man needs no better support, no richer reward,\nThan this common means,\nThrough which he is all men's equal."},{chapter:76,content:"What is more fluid, more yielding than water?\nYet back it comes again, wearing down the rigid strength\nWhich cannot yield to withstand it.\nSo it is that the strong are overcome by the weak,\nThe haughty by the humble.\nThis we know\nBut never learn,\nSo that when wise men tell us,\n'He who bites the dust\nIs owner of the earth,\nHe who is scapegoat\nIs king,'\nThey seem to twist the truth."},{chapter:77,content:"If terms to end a quarrel leave bad feeling,\nWhat good are they?\nSo a sensible man takes the poor end of the bargain\nWithout quibbling.\nIt is sensible to make terms,\nFoolish to be a stickler:\nThough heaven prefer no man,\nA sensible man prefers heaven."},{chapter:78,content:"If a land is small and its people are few,\nWith tenfold enough to have and to do,\nAnd if no one has schooled them to waste

Reason's standard is intrinsic."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is of the light the root, and rest is motion's master.\n\nTherefore the holy man in his daily walk does not depart from gravity. Although he may have magnificent sights, he calmly sits with liberated mind.\n\nBut how is it when the master of the ten thousand chariots in his personal conduct is too light for the empire? If he is too light he will lose his vassals. If he is too passionate he will lose the throne."},{chapter:27,content:'"Good travelers leave no trace nor track,\nGood speakers, in logic show no lack,\nGood counters need no counting rack.\n\n"Good lockers bolting bars need not,\nYet none their locks can loose.\nGood binders need no string nor knot,\nYet none unties their noose."\n\nTherefore the holy man is always a good saviour of men, for there are no outcast people. He is always a good saviour of things, for there are no outcast things. This is called applied enlightenment.\n\nThus the good man does not respect multitudes of men. The bad man respects the people\'s wealth. Who does not esteem multitudes nor is charmed by their wealth, though his knowledge be greatly confused, he must be recognized as profoundly spiritual.'},{chapter:28,content:"\"Who his manhood shows\nAnd his womanhood knows\nBecomes the empire's river.\nIs he the empire's river,\nHe will from virtue never deviate,\nAnd home he turneth to a child's estate.\n\n\"Who his brightness shows\nAnd his blackness knows\nBecomes the empire's model.\nIs he the empire's model,\nOf virtue ne'er shall he be destitute,\nAnd home he turneth to the absolute.\n\n\"Who knows his fame\nAnd guards his shame\nBecomes the empire's valley.\nIs he the empire's valley,\nFor e'er his virtue will sufficient be,\nAnd home he turneth to simplicity.\"\n\nSimplicity, when scattered, becomes a vessel of usefulness. The holy man, by using it, becomes the chief leader; and truly, a great principle will never do harm."},{chapter:29,content:'When one desires to take in hand the empire and make it, I see him not succeed. The empire is a divine vessel which cannot be made. One who makes it, mars it. One who takes it, loses it.\n\nAnd it is said of beings:\n"Some are obsequious, others move boldly,\nSome breathe warmly, others coldly,\nSome are strong and others weak,\nSome rise proudly, others sneak."\n\nTherefore the holy man abandons excess, he abandons extravagance, he abandons indulgence.'},{chapter:30,content:"He who with Reason assists the master of mankind will not with arms strengthen the empire. His methods invite requital.\n\nWhere armies are quartered briars and thorns grow. Great wars unfailingly are followed by famines. A good man acts resolutely and then stops. He ventures not to take by force.\n\nBe resolute but not boastful; resolute but not haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute because you cannot avoid it; resolute but not violent.\n\nThings thrive and then grow old. This is called un-Reason. Un-Reason soon ceases."},{chapter:31,content:"Even victorious arms are unblest among tools, and people had better shun them. Therefore he who has Reason does not rely on them.\n\nThe superior man when residing at home honors the left. When using arms, he honors the right.\n\nArms are unblest among tools and not the superior man's tools. Only when it is unavoidable he uses them. Peace and quietude he holdeth high.\n\nHe conquers but rejoices not. Rejoicing at a conquest means to enjoy the slaughter of men. He who enjoys the slaughter of men will most assuredly not obtain his will in the empire."},{chapter:32,content:"Reason, in its eternal aspect, is unnamable.\n\nAlthough its simplicity seems insignificant, the whole world does not dare to suppress it. If princes and kings could keep it, the ten thousand things would of themselves pay homage. Heaven and earth would unite in dripping sweet dew, and the people with no one to command them would of themselves be righteous.\n\nAs soon as Reason creates order, it becomes namable. Whenever the namable in its turn acquires existence, one learns to know when to stop. By knowing when to stop, one avoids danger.\n\nTo illustrate Reason's relation to the world we compare it to streams and creeks in their course towards rivers and the ocean."},{chapter:33,content:"One who knows others is clever, but one who knows himself is enlightened.\n\nOne who conquers others is powerful, but one who conquers himself is mighty.\n\nOne who knows contentment is rich and one who pushes with vigor has will.\n\nOne who loses not his place endures.\n\nOne who may die but will not perish, has life everlasting."},{chapter:34,content:"How all-pervading is the great Reason! It can be on the left and it can be on the right.\n\nThe ten thousand things depend upon it for their life, and it refuses them not. When its merit is accomplished it assumes not the name. Lovingly it nourishes the ten thousand things and plays not the lord. Ever desireless it can be classed with the small. The ten thousand things return home to it. It plays not the lord. It can be classed with the great.\n\nTherefore\n\nThe holy man unto death does not make himself great and can thus accomplish his greatness."},{chapter:35,content:'"Who holdeth fast to the great Form,\nOf him the world will come in quest:\nFor there we never meet with harm,\nThere we find shelter, comfort, rest."\n\nMusic with dainties makes the passing stranger stop.

Therefore it has virtue. Inferior virtue never loses sight of virtue. Therefore it has no virtue.\n\nSuperior virtue is non-assertion and without pretension. Inferior virtue asserts and makes pretensions.\n\nSuperior benevolence acts but makes no pretensions. Superior justice acts and makes pretensions.\n\nSuperior propriety acts and when no one responds to it, it stretches its arm and enforces its rules.\n\nThus one loses Reason and then virtue appears. One loses virtue and then benevolence appears. One loses benevolence and then justice appears. One loses justice and then propriety appears. The rules of propriety are the semblance of loyalty and faith, and the beginning of disorder.\n\nTraditionalism is the flower of Reason, but of ignorance the beginning.\n\nTherefore a great organizer abides by the solid and dwells not in the external. He abides in the fruit and dwells not in the flower.\n\nTherefore he discards the latter and chooses the former."},{chapter:39,content:'From of old these things have obtained oneness:\n\n"Heaven by oneness becometh pure.\nEarth by oneness can endure.\nMinds by oneness souls procure.\nValleys by oneness repletion secure.\n"All creatures by oneness to life have been called.\nAnd kings were by oneness as models installed."\n\nSuch is the result of oneness.\n\n"Were heaven not pure it might be rent.\nWere earth not stable it might be bent.\nWere minds not ensouled they\'d be impotent.\nWere valleys not filled they\'d soon be spent.\nWhen creatures are lifeless who can their death prevent?\nAre kings not models, but on haughtiness bent,\nTheir fall, forsooth, is imminent."\n\nThus, the nobles come from the commoners as their root, and the high rest upon the lowly as their foundation.

He will diminish and continue to diminish until he arrives at non-assertion.\n\nWith non-assertion there is nothing that he cannot achieve.

It is because they live life's intensity.\n\nYea, I understand that one whose life is based on goodness, when traveling on land will not fall a prey to the rhinoceros or the tiger. When coming among soldiers, he need not fear arms and weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place wherein to insert its horn. The tiger finds no place wherein to put his claws. Weapons find no place wherein to thrust their blades. The reason is that he does not belong to the realm of death."},{chapter:51,content:"Reason quickens all creatures. Virtue feeds them. Reality shapes them. The forces complete them. Therefore among the ten thousand things there is none that does not esteem Reason and honor virtue.\n\nSince the esteem of Reason and the honoring of virtue is by no one commanded, it is forever spontaneous.\n\nTherefore it is said that Reason quickens all creatures, while virtue feeds them, raises them, nurtures them, completes them, matures them, rears them, and protects them.\n\nTo quicken but not to own, to make but not to claim, to raise but not to rule, this is called profound virtue."},{chapter:52,content:"When the world takes its beginning, Reason becomes the world's mother.\n\nAs one knows his mother, so she in turn knows her child; as she quickens her child, so he in turn keeps to his mother, and to the end of life he is not in danger. Who closes his mouth, and shuts his sense-gates, in the end of life he will encounter no trouble; but who opens his mouth and meddles with affairs, in the end of life he cannot be saved.\n\nWho beholds his smallness is called enlightened. Who preserves his tenderness is called strong. Who uses Reason's light and returns home to its enlightenment does not surrender his person to perdition.

It is but expansion that I must fear.\n\nThe great Reason is very plain, but people are fond of by-paths.\n\nWhen the palace is very splendid, the fields are very weedy and granaries very empty.\n\nTo wear ornaments and gay clothes, to carry sharp swords, to be excessive in drinking and eating, to have a redundance of costly articles, this is the pride of robbers.\n\nSurely, this is un-Reason."},{chapter:54,content:"\"What is well planted is not uprooted;\nWhat's well preserved can not be looted!\"\n\nBy sons and grandsons the sacrificial celebrations shall not cease.\n\nWho cultivates Reason in his person, his virtue is genuine.\n\nWho cultivates it in his house, his virtue is overflowing.\n\nWho cultivates it in his township, his virtue is lasting.\n\nWho cultivates it in his country, his virtue is abundant.\n\nWho cultivates it in the world, his virtue is universal.\n\nTherefore,\n\nBy one's person one tests persons.\n\nBy one's house one tests houses.\n\nBy one's township one tests townships.\n\nBy one's country one tests countries.\n\nBy one's world one tests worlds.\n\nHow do I know that the world is such? Through IT."},{chapter:55,content:"He who possesses virtue in all its solidity is like unto a little child.\n\nVenomous reptiles do not sting him, fierce beasts do not seize him. Birds of prey do not strike him. His bones are weak, his sinews tender, but his grasp is firm. He does not yet know the relation between male and female, but his virility is strong. Thus his metal grows to perfection. A whole day he might cry and sob without growing hoarse. This shows the perfection of his harmony.\n\nTo know the harmonious is called the eternal. To know the eternal is called enlightenment.\n\nTo increase life is called a blessing, and heart-directed vitality is called strength, but things vigorous are about to grow old and I call this un-Reason.\n\nUn-Reason soon ceases!"},{chapter:56,content:'One who knows does not talk. One who talks does not know. Therefore the sage keeps his mouth shut and his sense-gates closed.\n\n"He will blunt his own sharpness, His own tangles adjust; He will dim his own radiance, And be one with his dust."\n\nThis is called profound identification.\n\nThus he is inaccessible to love and also inaccessible to enmity. He is inaccessible to profit and inaccessible to loss. He is also inaccessible to favor and inaccessible to disgrace. Thus he becomes world-honored.'},{chapter:57,content:"With rectitude one governs the state; with craftiness one leads the army; with non-diplomacy one takes the empire. How do I know that it is so? Through IT.\n\nThe more restrictions and prohibitions are in the empire, the poorer grow the people. The more weapons the people have, the more troubled is the state. The more there is cunning and skill, the more startling events will happen. The more mandates and laws are enacted, the more there will be thieves and robbers.\n\nTherefore the holy man says: I practise non-assertion, and the people of themselves reform. I love quietude, and the people of themselves become righteous. I use no diplomacy, and the people of themselves become rich.

It will not be prevented!\n\nWhat is ordinary becomes again extraordinary. What is good becomes again unpropitious. This bewilders people, and it happens constantly since times immemorial.\n\nTherefore the holy man is square but not sharp, strict but not obnoxious, upright but not restraining, bright but not dazzling."},{chapter:59,content:"To govern the people is the affair of heaven and there is nothing like thrift.\n\nNow consider that thrift is said to come from early practice.\n\nBy early practice it is said that we can accumulate an abundance of virtue. If one accumulates an abundance of virtue then there is nothing that can not be overcome.\n\nWhen nothing can not be overcome then no one knows his limit. When no one knows his limit one can have possession of the commonwealth.\n\nWho has possession of the commonwealth's mother [thrift] may last and abide.\n\nThis is called the possession of deep roots and of a staunch stem. To life, to everlastingness, to comprehension, this is the way."},{chapter:60,content:"Govern a great country as you would fry small fish: [neither gut nor scale them.]\n\nIf with Reason the empire is managed, its ghosts will not spook. Not only will its ghosts not spook, but its gods will not harm the people. Not only will its gods not harm the people, but neither will its holy men harm the people. Since neither will do harm, therefore their virtues will be combined."},{chapter:61,content:"A great state, one that lowly flows, becomes the empire's union, and the empire's wife.\n\nThe wife always through quietude conquers her husband, and by quietude renders herself lowly.\n\nThus a great state through lowliness toward small states will conquer the small states, and small states through lowliness toward great states will conquer great states.\n\nTherefore some render themselves lowly for the purpose of conquering; others are lowly and therefore conquer.\n\nA great state desires no more than to unite and feed the people; a small state desires no more than to devote itself to the service of the people; but that both may obtain their wishes, the greater one must stoop."},{chapter:62,content:"The man of Reason is the ten thousand creatures' refuge, the good man's wealth, the bad man's stay.\n\nWith beautiful words one can sell. With honest conduct one can do still more with the people.\n\nIf a man be bad, why should he be thrown away? Therefore, an emperor was elected and three ministers appointed; but better than holding before one's face the jade table [of the ministry] and riding with four horses, is sitting still and propounding the eternal Reason.\n\nWhy do the ancients prize this Reason? Is it not, say, because when sought it is obtained and the sinner thereby can be saved? Therefore it is world-honored."},{chapter:63,content:"Assert non-assertion.\n\nPractise non-practice.\n\nTaste the tasteless.\n\nMake great the small.\n\nMake much the little.\n\nRequite hatred with virtue.\n\nContemplate a difficulty when it is easy. Manage a great thing when it is small.\n\nThe world's most difficult undertakings necessarily originate while easy, and the world's greatest undertakings necessarily originate while small.\n\nTherefore the holy man to the end does not venture to play the great, and thus he can accomplish his greatness.\n\nRash promises surely lack faith, and many easy things surely involve in many difficulties.\n\nTherefore, the holy man regards everything as difficult, and thus to the end encounters no difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"What is still at rest is easily kept quiet. What has not as yet appeared is easily prevented. What is still feeble is easily broken. What is still scant is easily dispersed.\n\nTreat things before they exist. Regulate things before disorder begins. The stout tree has originated from a tiny rootlet. A tower of nine stories is raised by heaping up [bricks of] clay. A thousand miles' journey begins with a foot.\n\nHe that makes mars. He that grasps loses.\n\nThe holy man does not make; therefore he mars not. He does not grasp; therefore he loses not. The people when undertaking an enterprise are always near completion, and yet they fail.\n\nRemain careful to the end as in the beginning and you will not fail in your enterprise.\n\nTherefore the holy man desires to be desireless, and does not prize articles difficult to obtain. He learns, not to be learned, and seeks a home where multitudes of people pass by.\n\nHe assists the ten thousand things in their natural development, but he does not venture to interfere."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancients who were well versed in Reason did not thereby enlighten the people; they intended thereby to make them simple-hearted.\n\nIf people are difficult to govern, it is because they are too smart. To govern the country with smartness is the country's curse. To govern the country without smartness is the country's blessing. He who knows these two things is also a model [like the ancients]. Always to know the model is called profound virtue.\n\nSpiritual virtue, verily, is profound. Verily, it is far-reaching. Verily, it is to everything reverse. But then it will procure great recognition."},{chapter:66,content:"That rivers and oceans can of the hundred valleys be kings is due to their excelling in lowliness. Thus they can of the hundred valleys be the kings.\n\nTherefore the holy man, when anxious to be above the people, must in his words keep underneath them. When anxious to lead the people, he must with his person keep behind them.\n\nTherefore the holy man dwells above, but the people are not burdened. He is ahead, but the people suffer no harm.\n\nTherefore the world rejoices in exalting him and does not tire. Because he strives not, no one in the world will strive with him."},{chapter:67,content:"He who excels as a warrior is not warlike. He who excels as a fighter is not wrathful. He who excels in conquering the enemy does not strive. He who excels in employing men is lowly.\n\nThis is called the virtue of not-striving. This is called utilizing men's ability. This is called complying with heaven-since olden times the highest."},{chapter:68,content:"A military expert used to say: 'I dare not act as host [who takes the initiative] but act as guest [with reserve]. I dare not advance an inch, but I withdraw a foot.\"\n\nThis is called marching without marching, threatening without arms, charging without hostility, seizing without weapons.\n\nNo greater misfortune than making light of the enemy! When we make light of the enemy, it is almost as though we had lost our treasure--[compassion].\n\nThus, if matched armies encounter one another, the one who does so in sorrow is sure to conquer."},{chapter:69,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practise, but in the world no one can understand, no one can practise them.\n\nWords have an ancestor; Deeds have a master [viz., Reason]. Since he is not understood, therefore I am not understood. Those who understand me are few, and thus I am distinguished.\n\nTherefore the holy man wears wool, and hides in his bosom his jewels."},{chapter:70,content:"To know the unknowable, that is elevating. Not to know the knowable, that is sickness.\n\nOnly by becoming sick of sickness can we be without sickness.\n\nThe holy man is not sick. Because he is sick of sickness, therefore he is not sick."},{chapter:71,content:"If the people do not fear the dreadful, the great dreadful will come, surely.\n\nLet them not deem their lives narrow. Let them not deem their lot wearisome. When it is not deemed wearisome, then it will not be wearisome.\n\nTherefore the holy man knows himself but does not display himself. He holds himself dear but does not honor himself. Thus he discards the latter and chooses the former."},{chapter:72,content:'Courage, if carried to daring, leads to death; courage, if not carried to daring, leads to life. Either of these two things is sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful.\n\n"Why \u2019t is by heaven rejected,\nWho has the reason detected?"\n\nTherefore the holy man also regards it as difficult.\n\nThe Heavenly Reason strives not, but it is sure to conquer.

It is wide-meshed, but it loses nothing.'},{chapter:73,content:"If the people do not fear death, how can they be frightened by death? If we make people fear death, and supposing some would [still] venture to rebel, if we seize them for capital punishment, who will dare?\n\nThere is always an executioner who kills. Now to take the place of the executioner who kills is taking the place of the great carpenter who hews. If a man takes the place of the great carpenter who hews, he will rarely, indeed, fail to injure his hand."},{chapter:74,content:"The people hunger because their superiors consume too many taxes; therefore they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors are too meddlesome; therefore they are difficult to govern. The people make light of death on account of the intensity of their clinging to life; therefore they make light of death.\n\nHe who is not bent on life is worthier than he who esteems life."},{chapter:75,content:"Man during life is tender and delicate. When he dies he is stiff and stark.\n\nThe ten thousand things, the grass as well as the trees, while they live are tender and supple. When they die they are rigid and dry.\n\nThus the hard and the strong are the companions of death. The tender and the delicate are the companions of life.\n\nTherefore he who in arms is strong will not conquer.\n\nWhen a tree has grown strong it is doomed.\n\nThe strong and the great stay below. The tender and the delicate stay above."},{chapter:76,content:"Is not Heaven's Reason truly like stretching a bow? The high it brings down, the lowly it lifts up. Those who have abundance it depleteth; those who are deficient it augmenteth.\n\nSuch is Heaven's Reason. It depleteth those who have abundance but completeth the deficient.\n\nMan's Reason is not so. He depleteth the deficient in order to serve those who have abundance.\n\nWhere is he who would have abundance for serving the world?\n\nIndeed, it is the holy man who acts but claims not; merit he acquires but he does not dwell upon it, and does he ever show any anxiety to display his excellence?"},{chapter:77,content:"In the world nothing is tenderer and more delicate than water. In attacking the hard and the strong nothing will surpass it. There is nothing that herein takes its place.\n\nThe weak conquer the strong, the tender conquer the rigid. In the world there is no one who does not know it, but no one will practise it.\n\nTherefore the holy man says:\n\n\"Him who the country's sin makes his,\nWe hail as priest at the great sacrifice.\nHim who the curse bears of the country's failing.\nAs king of the empire we are hailing.\"\n\nTrue words seem paradoxical."},{chapter:78,content:"When a great hatred is reconciled, naturally some hatred will remain. How can this be made good?\n\nTherefore the sage keeps the obligations of his contract and exacts not from others. Those who have virtue attend to their obligations; those who have no virtue attend to their claims.\n\nHeaven's Reason shows no preference but always assists the good man."},{chapter:79,content:"True words are not pleasant; pleasant words are not true. The good are not contentious; the contentious are not good. The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\n\nThe holy man hoards not. The more he does for others, the more he owns himself. The more he gives to others, the more will he himself lay up an abundance.\n\nHeaven's Reason is to benefit but not to injure; the holy man's Reason is to accomplish but not to strive."}]},{name:"James Legge",date:1891,component:[{chapter:1,content:"The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and\nunchanging Tao.

The work is accomplished, and there is no\nresting in it (as an achievement).\n\nThe work is done, but how no one can see;\n'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be."},{chapter:3,content:"Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to\nkeep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles\nwhich are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming\nthieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is\nthe way to keep their minds from disorder.\n\nTherefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties\ntheir minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens\ntheir bones.\n\nHe constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without\ndesire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them\nfrom presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from\naction, good order is universal."},{chapter:4,content:"The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our\nemployment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How\ndeep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of\nall things!\n\nWe should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of\nthings; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into\nagreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao\nis, as if it would ever so continue!\n\nI do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before\nGod."},{chapter:5,content:"Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be\nbenevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt\nwith. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they\ndeal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.\n\nMay not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a\nbellows?\n\n'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;\n'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.\nMuch speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;\nYour inner being guard, and keep it free."},{chapter:6,content:"The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;\nThe female mystery thus do we name.\nIts gate, from which at first they issued forth,\nIs called the root from which grew heaven and earth.\nLong and unbroken does its power remain,\nUsed gently, and without the touch of pain."},{chapter:7,content:"Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason\nwhy heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is\nbecause they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are\nable to continue and endure.\n\nTherefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in\nthe foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him,\nand yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no\npersonal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?"},{chapter:8,content:"The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence\nof water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying,\nwithout striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men\ndislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao.\n\nThe excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place;\nthat of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in\ntheir being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing\ngood order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and\nthat of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.\n\nAnd when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about\nhis low position), no one finds fault with him."},{chapter:9,content:"It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to\ncarry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been\nsharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.\n\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them\nsafe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil\non itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming\ndistinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven."},{chapter:10,content:"When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one\nembrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided\nattention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of\npliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away\nthe most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without\na flaw.\n\nIn loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed\nwithout any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his\ngates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his\nintelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be\nwithout knowledge?\n\n(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces\nthem and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not\nboast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them.\nThis is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao)."},{chapter:11,content:"The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty\nspace (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is\nfashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that\ntheir use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls)\nto form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its\nuse depends.

He puts from him the\nlatter, and prefers to seek the former."},{chapter:13,content:"Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and\ngreat calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same\nkind).\n\nWhat is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is\nbeing in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting\nthat (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing\nit leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is\nmeant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be\nfeared.\n\nAnd what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be\n(similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to\ngreat calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had\nnot the body, what great calamity could come to me?\n\nTherefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he\nhonours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would\nadminister it with the love which he bears to his own person may be\nentrusted with it."},{chapter:14,content:"We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the\nEquable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the\nInaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we\nname it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made\nthe subject of description; and hence we blend them together and\nobtain The One.\n\nIts upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure.\nCeaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again\nreturns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless,\nand the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and\nIndeterminable.\n\nWe meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see\nits Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things\nof the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the\nbeginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao."},{chapter:15,content:"The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle\nand exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep\n(also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's\nknowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they\nappeared to be.\n\nShrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in\nwinter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave\nlike a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting\naway; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into\nanything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.\n\nWho can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it\nwill gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest?\nLet movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise.\n\nThey who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of\nthemselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that\nthey can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete."},{chapter:16,content:"The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree,\nand that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things\nalike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them\nreturn (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable\nworld) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them\nreturn to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the\nstate of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that\nthey have fulfilled their appointed end.\n\nThe report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To\nknow that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads\nto wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging\nrule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity\nand forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things).\nFrom this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he\nwho is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to\nheaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long;\nand to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay."},{chapter:17,content:"In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there\nwere (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised\nthem. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them.\nThus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers)\na want of faith in them ensued (in the people).\n\nHow irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by\ntheir reticence) the importance which they set upon their words!\nTheir work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the\npeople all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'"},{chapter:18,content:"When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed,\nbenevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom\nand shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy.\n\nWhen harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships,\nfilial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell\ninto disorder, loyal ministers appeared."},{chapter:19,content:"If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it\nwould be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce\nour benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again\nbecome filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful\ncontrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no\nthieves nor robbers.\n\nThose three methods (of government)\nThought olden ways in elegance did fail\nAnd made these names their want of worth to veil;\nBut simple views, and courses plain and true\nWould selfish ends and many lusts eschew."},{chapter:20,content:"When we renounce learning we have no troubles.\nThe (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'--\nSmall is the difference they display.\nBut mark their issues, good and ill;--\nWhat space the gulf between shall fill?\n\nWhat all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end\nis the range of questions (asking to be discussed)!\n\nThe multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a\nfull banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem\nlistless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of\ntheir presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look\ndejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of\nmen all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost\neverything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of\nchaos.\n\nOrdinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be\nbenighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull\nand confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as\nif I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while\nI alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone\nam different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao)."},{chapter:21,content:"The grandest forms of active force\nFrom Tao come, their only source.\nWho can of Tao the nature tell?\nOur sight it flies, our touch as well.\nEluding sight, eluding touch,\nThe forms of things all in it crouch;\nEluding touch, eluding sight,\nThere are their semblances, all right.\nProfound it is, dark and obscure;\nThings' essences all there endure.\nThose essences the truth enfold\nOf what, when seen, shall then be told.\nNow it is so; 'twas so of old.\nIts name--what passes not away;\nSo, in their beautiful array,\nThings form and never know decay.\n\nHow know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things?

He whose (desires) are few gets them; he\nwhose (desires) are many goes astray.\n\nTherefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of\nhumility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-\ndisplay, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore\nhe is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is\nacknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires\nsuperiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that\ntherefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.\n\nThat saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was\nnot vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it."},{chapter:23,content:"Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity\nof his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a\nsudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these\n(two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth\ncannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!\n\nTherefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are\nalso pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the\nmanifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while\neven those who are failing in both these things agree with him where\nthey fail.\n\nHence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness\nof attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation\nhave the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees\nin their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao).\n(But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of\nfaith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others)."},{chapter:24,content:"He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches\nhis legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does\nnot shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who\nvaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self-\nconceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed\nfrom the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour\non the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course)\nof the Tao do not adopt and allow them."},{chapter:25,content:"There was something undefined and complete, coming into\nexistence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless,\nstanding alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in\nno danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of\nall things.\n\nI do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao\n(the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I\ncall it The Great.\n\nGreat, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes\nremote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is\ngreat; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also\ngreat. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage)\nking is one of them.\n\nMan takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from\nHeaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its\nbeing what it is."},{chapter:26,content:"Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of\nmovement.\n\nTherefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far\nfrom his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to\nlook at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to\nthem. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly\nbefore the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of\ngravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne."},{chapter:27,content:"The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or\nfootsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault\nwith or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful\ncloser needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be\nimpossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to\nunloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the\nsage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any\nman; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast\naway anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.'\n\nTherefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him\nwho has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of\n(the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour\nhis master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an\n(observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is\ncalled 'The utmost degree of mystery.'"},{chapter:28,content:"Who knows his manhood's strength,\nYet still his female feebleness maintains;\nAs to one channel flow the many drains,\nAll come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.\nThus he the constant excellence retains;\nThe simple child again, free from all stains.\n\nWho knows how white attracts,\nYet always keeps himself within black's shade,\nThe pattern of humility displayed,\nDisplayed in view of all beneath the sky;\nHe in the unchanging excellence arrayed,\nEndless return to man's first state has made.\n\nWho knows how glory shines,\nYet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;\nBehold his presence in a spacious vale,\nTo which men come from all beneath the sky.\nThe unchanging excellence completes its tale;\nThe simple infant man in him we hail.\n\nThe unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms\nvessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the\nOfficers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs\nno violent measures."},{chapter:29,content:"If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to\neffect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The\nkingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He\nwho would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp\nloses it.\n\nThe course and nature of things is such that\nWhat was in front is now behind;\nWhat warmed anon we freezing find.\nStrength is of weakness oft the spoil;\nThe store in ruins mocks our toil.\n\nHence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy\nindulgence."},{chapter:30,content:"He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will\nnot assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course\nis sure to meet with its proper return.\n\nWherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the\nsequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years.\n\nA skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does\nnot dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his\nmastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against\nbeing vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes\nit as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for\nmastery.\n\nWhen things have attained their strong maturity they become old.\nThis may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not\nin accordance with it soon comes to an end."},{chapter:31,content:"Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen,\nhateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have\nthe Tao do not like to employ them.\n\nThe superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most\nhonourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp\nweapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the\nsuperior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm\nand repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him\nundesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the\nslaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot\nget his will in the kingdom.\n\nOn occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized\nposition; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in\ncommand of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding\nin chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him\nas in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men\nshould weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in\nbattle has his place (rightly) according to those rites."},{chapter:32,content:"The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name.\n\nThough in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole\nworld dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a\nfeudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would\nspontaneously submit themselves to him.\n\nHeaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down\nthe sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally\neverywhere as of its own accord.\n\nAs soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name.

It may be found on the left\nhand and on the right.\n\nAll things depend on it for their production, which it gives to\nthem, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is\naccomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it.

(Those who)\npossessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it\nout, and had need to be so doing.\n\n(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always\nseeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared\nthe arm and marched up to them.\n\nThus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared;\nwhen its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence\nwas lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the\nproprieties appeared.\n\nNow propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good\nfaith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is\n(only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity.\n\nThus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews\nwhat is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is\nthus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other."},{chapter:39,content:"The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are--\n\nHeaven which by it is bright and pure;\nEarth rendered thereby firm and sure;\nSpirits with powers by it supplied;\nValleys kept full throughout their void\nAll creatures which through it do live\nPrinces and kings who from it get\nThe model which to all they give.\n\nAll these are the results of the One (Tao).\n\nIf heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;\nIf earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;\nWithout these powers, the spirits soon would fail;\nIf not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;\nWithout that life, creatures would pass away;\nPrinces and kings, without that moral sway,\nHowever grand and high, would all decay.\n\nThus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous)\nmeanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from\nwhich it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,'\n'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this\nan acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see\nthe foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of\nthe different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it\nanswer the ends of a carriage.

It is not that\nthose manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be\nemployed to hurt men.

Stillness may be considered (a\nsort of) abasement.\n\nThus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states,\ngains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to\na great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement\nleads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour.\n\nThe great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them;\na small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.\nEach gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase\nitself."},{chapter:62,content:"Tao has of all things the most honoured place.\nNo treasures give good men so rich a grace;\nBad men it guards, and doth their ill efface.\n\n(Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds\ncan raise their performer above others.

Was it not\nbecause it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape\n(from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all\nunder heaven consider it the most valuable thing."},{chapter:63,content:"(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting;\nto conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste\nwithout discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great,\nand a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.\n\n(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they\nare easy, and does things that would become great while they are\nsmall. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a\nprevious state in which they were easy, and all great things from one\nin which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does\nwhat is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest\nthings.\n\nHe who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is\ncontinually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.\nTherefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so\nnever has any difficulties."},{chapter:64,content:"That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing\nhas given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures\nagainst it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very\nsmall is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has\nmade its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has\nbegun.\n\nThe tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the\ntower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey\nof a thousand li commenced with a single step.\n\nHe who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold\nof a thing (in the same way) loses his hold.

(But) people in their conduct of\naffairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of\nsuccess. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the\nbeginning, they would not so ruin them.\n\nTherefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does\nnot prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not\nlearn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by.\nThus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare\nto act (with an ulterior purpose of his own)."},{chapter:65,content:"The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did\nso, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and\nignorant.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people arises from their having\nmuch knowledge.

So it is\nthat the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his\nwords below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person\nbehind them.\n\nIn this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his\nweight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an\ninjury to them.\n\nTherefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of\nhim.

These two things spirit and matter, so different in nature, have the same origin. This unity of origin is the mystery of mysteries, but it is the gateway to spirituality."},{chapter:2,content:"When every one recognizes beauty to be only a masquerade, then it is simply ugliness. In the same way goodness, if it is not sincere, is not goodness. So existence and non-existence are incompatible. The difficult and easy are mutually opposites. Just as the long and the short, the high and the low, the loud and soft, the before and the behind, are all opposites and each reveals the other.\n\nTherefore the wise man is not conspicuous in his affairs or given to much talking.

To win true merit, to preserve just fame, the personality must be retiring. This is the heavenly Tao."},{chapter:10,content:"By patience the animal spirits can be disciplined. By self-control one can unify the character. By close attention to the will, compelling gentleness, one can become like a little child. By purifying the subconscious desires one may be without fault. In ruling his country, if the wise magistrate loves his people, he can avoid compulsion.\n\nIn measuring out rewards, the wise magistrate will act like a mother bird. While sharply penetrating into every corner, he may appear to be unsuspecting. While quickening and feeding his people, he will be producing but without pride of ownership. He will benefit but without claim of reward. He will persuade, but not compel by force. This is teh, the profoundest virtue."},{chapter:11,content:"Although the wheel has thirty spokes its utility lies in the emptiness of the hub. The jar is made by kneading clay, but its usefulness consists in its capacity. A room is made by cutting out windows and doors through the walls, but the space the walls contain measures the room's value.\n\nIn the same way matter is necessary to form, but the value of reality lies in its immateriality.\n\n(Or thus: a material body is necessary to existence, but the value of a life is measured by its immaterial soul.)"},{chapter:12,content:"An excess of light blinds the human eye; an excess of noise ruins the ear; an excess of condiments deadens the taste. The effect of too much horse racing and hunting is bad, and the lure of hidden treasure tempts one to do evil.\n\nTherefore the wise man attends to the inner significance of things and does not concern himself with outward appearances. Therefore he ignores matter and seeks the spirit."},{chapter:13,content:"Favor and disgrace are alike to be feared, just as too great care or anxiety are bad for the body.\n\nWhy are favor and disgrace alike to be feared? To be favored is humiliating; to obtain it is as much to be dreaded as to lose it. To lose favor is to be in disgrace and of course is to be dreaded.\n\nWhy are excessive care and great anxiety alike bad for one? The very reason I have anxiety is because I have a body. If I have not body why would I be anxious?\n\nTherefore if he who administers the empire, esteems it as his own body, then he is worthy to be trusted with the empire."},{chapter:14,content:"It is unseen because it is colorless; it is unheard because it is soundless; when seeking to grasp it, it eludes one, because it is incorporeal.\n\nBecause of these qualities it cannot be examined, and yet they form an essential unity. Superficially it appears abstruse, but in its depths it is not obscure. It has been nameless forever! It appears and then disappears. It is what is known as the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. It is called the transcendental, its face (or destiny) cannot be seen in front, or its back (or origin) behind.\n\nBut by holding fast to the Tao of the ancients, the wise man may understand the present, because he knows the origin of the past. This is the clue to the Tao."},{chapter:15,content:"In olden times the ones who were considered worthy to be called masters were subtle, spiritual, profound, wise. Their thoughts could not be easily understood.\n\nSince they were hard to understand I will try to make them clear. They were cautious like men wading a river in winter. They were reluctant like men who feared their neighbors. They were reserved like guests in the presence of their host. They were elusive like ice at the point of melting. They were like unseasoned wood. They were like a valley between high mountains. They were obscure like troubled waters. (They were cautious because they were conscious of the deeper meanings of life and its possibilities.)\n\nWe can clarify troubled waters by slowly quieting them. We can bring the unconscious to life by slowly moving them. But he who has the secret of the Tao does not desire for more. Being content, he is able to mature without desire to be newly fashioned."},{chapter:16,content:"Seek to attain an open mind (the summit of vacuity). Seek composure (the essence of tranquillity).\n\nAll things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquillity; it is moving towards its destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.\n\nKnowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; nobility is like heaven.\n\nThe heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is not to be feared."},{chapter:17,content:"When great men rule, subjects know little of their existence. Rulers who are less great win the affection and praise of their subjects. A common ruler is feared by his subjects, and an unworthy ruler is despised.\n\nWhen a ruler lacks faith, you may seek in vain for it among his subjects.\n\nHow carefully a wise ruler chooses his words. He performs deeds, and accumulates merit! Under such a ruler the people think they are ruling themselves."},{chapter:18,content:"When the great Tao is lost sight of, we still have the idea of benevolence and righteousness. Prudence and wisdom come to mind when we see great hypocrisy. When relatives are! unfriendly, we still have the teachings of filial piety and paternal affection. When the state and the clan are in confusion and disorder, we still have the ideals of loyalty and faithfulness."},{chapter:19,content:"Abandon the show of saintliness and relinquish excessive prudence, then people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon ostentatious benevolence and conspicuous righteousness, then people will return to the primal virtues of filial piety and parental affection. Abandon cleverness and relinquish gains, then thieves and robbers will disappear.\n\nHere are three fundamentals on which to depend, wherein culture is insufficient. Therefore let all men hold to that which is reliable, namely, recognize simplicity, cherish purity, reduce one's possessions, diminish one's desires."},{chapter:20,content:'Avoid learning if you would have no anxiety. The "yes" and the "yea" differ very little, but the contrast between good and evil is very great. That which is not feared by the people is not worth fearing. But, oh, the difference, the desolation, the vastness, between ignorance and the limitless expression of the Tao.\n\n(The balance of this sonnet is devoted to showing the difference between the careless state of the common people and his own vision of the Tao. It is one of the most pathetic expressions of human loneliness, from lack of appreciation, ever written. It is omitted here that it might serve for the closing sonnet and valedictory.)'},{chapter:21,content:"All the innumerable forms of teh correspond to the norm of Tao, but the nature of the Tao's activity is infinitely abstract and illusive. Illusive and obscure, indeed, but at its heart are forms and types. Vague and illusive, indeed, but at its heart is all being. Unfathomable and obscure, indeed, but at its heart is all spirit, and spirit is reality. At its heart is truth.\n\nFrom of old its expression is unceasing, it has been present at all beginnings. How do I know that its nature is thus? By this same Tao."},{chapter:22,content:'At that time the deficient will be made perfect; the distorted will be straightened; the empty will be filled; the worn out will be renewed; those having little will obtain and those having much will be overcome.\n\nTherefore the wise man, embracing unity as he does, will become the world\'s model. Not pushing himself forward he will become enlightened; not asserting himself he will become distinguished; not boasting of himself he will acquire merit; not approving himself he will endure. Forasmuch as he will not quarrel, the world will not quarrel with him.\n\nIs the old saying, "The crooked shall be made straight," a false saying? Indeed, no! They will be perfected and return rejoicing.'},{chapter:23,content:"Taciturnity is natural to man. A whirlwind never outlasts the morning, nor a violent rain the day. What is the cause? It is heaven and earth. If even heaven and earth are not constant, much less can man be.\n\nTherefore he who pursues his affairs in the spirit of Tao will become Tao-like. He who pursues his affairs with teh, will become teh-like. He who pursues his affairs with loss, identifies himself with loss.\n\nHe who identifies himself with Tao, Tao rejoices to guide. He who identifies himself with teh, teh rejoices to reward. And he who identifies himself with loss, loss rejoices to ruin.\n\nIf his faith fail, he will receive no reward of faith."},{chapter:24,content:"It is not natural to stand on tiptoe, or being astride one does not walk. One who displays himself is not bright, or one who asserts himself cannot shine. A self-approving man has no merit, nor does one who praises himself grow.\n\nThe relation of these things (self-display, self-assertion, self-approval) to Tao is the same as offal is to food. They are excrescences from the system; they are detestable; Tao does not dwell in them."},{chapter:25,content:"There is Being that is all-inclusive and that existed before Heaven and Earth. Calm, indeed, and incorporeal! It is alone and changeless!\n\nEverywhere it functions unhindered. It thereby becomes the world's mother. I do not know its nature; if I try to characterize it, I will call it Tao.\n\nIf forced to give it a name, I will call it the Great. The Great is evasive, the evasive is the distant, the distant is ever coming near. Tao is Great. So is Heaven great, and so is Earth and so also is the representative of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMan is derived from nature, nature is derived from Heaven, Heaven is derived from Tao. Tao is self-derived."},{chapter:26,content:"The heavy is the root of the light; the quiet is master of motion. Therefore the wise man in all the experience of the day will not depart from dignity. Though he be surrounded with sights that are magnificent, he will remain calm and unconcerned.\n\nHow does it come to pass that the Emperor, master of ten thousand chariots, has lost the mastery of the Empire? Because being flippant himself, he has lost the respect of his subjects; being passionate himself, he has lost the control of the Empire."},{chapter:27,content:"Good walkers leave no tracks, good speakers make no errors, good counters need no abacus, good wardens have no need for bolts and locks for no one can get by them. Good binders can dispense with rope and cord, yet none can unloose their hold.\n\nTherefore the wise man trusting in goodness always saves men, for there is no outcast to him. Trusting in goodness he saves all things for there is nothing valueless to him. This is recognizing concealed values.\n\nTherefore the good man is the instructor of the evil man, and the evil man is the good man's wealth. He who does not esteem his instructors or value his wealth, though he be otherwise intelligent, becomes confused. Herein lies the significance of spirituality."},{chapter:28,content:"He who knows his manhood and understands his womanhood becomes useful like the valleys of earth (which bring water). Being like the valleys of earth, eternal vitality (teh) will not depart from him, he will come again to the nature of a little child.\n\nHe who knows his innocence and recognizes his sin becomes the world's model. Being a world's model, infinite teh will not fail, he will return to the Absolute.\n\nHe who knows the glory of his nature and recognizes also his limitations becomes useful like the world's valleys. Being like the world's valleys, eternal teh will not fail him, he will revert to simplicity.\n\nRadiating simplicity he will make of men vessels of usefulness. The wise man then will employ them as officials and chiefs. A great administration of such will harm no one."},{chapter:29,content:"One who desires to take and remake the Empire will fail. The Empire is a divine thing that cannot be remade. He who attempts it will only mar it.\n\nHe who seeks to grasp it, will lose it. People differ, some lead, others follow; some are ardent, others are formal; some are strong, others weak; some succeed, others fail. Therefore the wise man practices moderation; he abandons pleasure, extravagance and indulgence."},{chapter:30,content:"When the magistrate follows Tao, he has no need to resort to force of arms to strengthen the Empire, because his business methods alone will show good returns.\n\nBriars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad harvests are the sequence of a great war. The good ruler will be resolute and then stop, he dare not take by force. One should be resolute but not boastful; resolute but not haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute but yielding when it cannot be avoided; resolute but he must not resort to violence.\n\nBy a resort to force, things flourish for a time but then decay. This is not like the Tao and that which is not Tao-like will soon cease."},{chapter:31,content:"Even successful arms, among all implements, are unblessed. All men come to detest them. Therefore the one who follows Tao does not rely on them. Arms are of all tools unblessed, they are not the implements of a wise man. Only as a last resort does he use them.\n\nPeace and quietude are esteemed by the wise man, and even when victorious he does not rejoice, because rejoicing over a victory is the same as rejoicing over the killing of men. If he rejoices over killing men, do you think he will ever really master the Empire?\n\nIn propitious affairs the place of honor is the left, but in unpropitious affairs we honor the right.\n\nThe strong man while at home esteems the left as the place of honor, but when armed for war it is as though he esteems the right hand, the place of less honor.\n\nThus a funeral ceremony is so arranged. The place of a subordinate army officer is also on the left and the place of his superior officer is on the right. The killing of men fills multitudes with sorrow; we lament with tears because of it, and rightly honor the victor as if he was attending a funeral ceremony."},{chapter:32,content:"Tao in its eternal aspect is unnamable. Its simplicity appears insignificant, but the whole world cannot control it. If princes and kings employ it every one of themselves will pay willing homage. Heaven and Earth by it are harmoniously combined and drop sweet dew. People will have no need of rulers, because of themselves they will be righteous.\n\nAs soon as Tao expresses itself in orderly creation then it becomes comprehensible. When one recognizes the presence of Tao he understands where to stop. Knowing where to stop he is free from danger.\n\nTo illustrate the nature of Tao's place in the universe: Tao is like the brooks and streams in their relation to the great rivers and the ocean."},{chapter:33,content:"He who knows others is intelligent; he who understands himself is enlightened; he who is able to conquer others has force, but he who is able to control himself is mighty. He who appreciates contentment is wealthy.\n\nHe who dares to act has nerve; if he can maintain his position he will endure, but he, who dying does not perish, is immortal."},{chapter:34,content:"Great Tao is all pervading! It can be on both the right hand and the left. Everything relies upon it for their existence, and it does not fail them. It acquires merit but covets not the title. It lovingly nourishes everything, but does not claim the rights of ownership. It has no desires, it can be classed with the small. Everything returns to it, yet it does not claim the right of ownership. It can be classed with the great.\n\nTherefore the wise man to the end will not pose as a great man, and by so doing will express his true greatness."},{chapter:35,content:"The world will go to him who grasps this Great Principle; they will seek and not be injured, they will find contentment, peace and rest.\n\nMusic and dainties attract the passing people, while Tao's reality seen-is insipid. Indeed it has no taste, when looked at there is not enough seen to be prized, when listened for, it can scarcely be heard, but, the use of it is inexhaustible."},{chapter:36,content:"That which has a tendency to contract must first have been extended; that which has a tendency to weaken itself must first have been strong; that which shows a tendency to destroy itself must first have been raised up; that which shows a tendency to scatter must first have been gathered.\n\nThis is the explanation of a seeming contradiction: the tender and yielding conquer the rigid and strong (i.e., spirit is stronger than matter, persuasion than force). The fish would be foolish to seek escape from its natural environment. There is no gain to a nation to compel by a show of force."},{chapter:37,content:"Tao is apparently inactive (wu wei) and yet nothing remains undone. If princes and kings desire to keep) everything in order, they must first reform themselves. (If princes and kings would follow the example of Tao, then all things will reform themselves.) If they still desire to change, I would pacify them by the simplicity of the ineffable Tao.\n\nThis simplicity will end desire, and if desire be absent there is quietness. All people will of themselves be satisfied."},{chapter:38,content:"Essential teh makes no show of virtue, and therefore it is really virtuous. Inferior virtue never loses sight of itself and therefore it is no longer virtue. Essential virtue is characterized by lack of self-assertion (wu wei) and therefore is unpretentious. Inferior virtue is acting a part and thereby is only pretense.\n\nSuperior benevolence in a way is acting but does not thereby become pretentious. Excessive righteousness is acting and does thereby become pretentious. Excessive propriety is acting, but where no one responds to it, it stretches its arm and enforces obedience.\n\nTherefore when one loses Tao there is still teh; one may lose teh and benevolence remains; one may forsake benevolence and still hold to righteousness; one may lose righteousness and propriety remains.\n\nPropriety, alone, reduces loyalty and good faith to a shadow, and it is the beginning of disorder. Tradition is the mere flower of the Tao and had its origin in ignorance.\n\nTherefore the great man of affairs conforms to the spirit and not to external appearance. He goes on to fruitage and does not rest in the show of blossom. He avoids mere propriety and practices true benevolence."},{chapter:39,content:"It has been said of old, only those who attain unity attain self-hood. . . . Heaven attained unity and thereby is space. Earth attained unity, thereby it is solid. Spirit attained unity, thereby it became mind. Valleys attained unity, therefore rivers flow down them. All things have unity and thereby have life. Princes and kings as they attain unity become standards of conduct for the nation. And the highest unity is that which produces unity.\n\nIf heaven were not space it might crack, if earth were not solid it might bend. If spirits were not unified into mind they might vanish, if valleys were not adapted to rivers they would be parched. Everything if it were not for life would burn up. Even princes and kings if they overestimate themselves and cease to be standards will presumably fall.\n\nTherefore nobles find their roots among the commoners; the high is always founded upon the low. The reason why princes and kings speak of themselves as orphans, inferiors and unworthy, is because they recognize that their roots run down to the common life; is it not so?\n\nIf a carriage goes to pieces it is no longer a carriage, its unity is gone. A true self-hood does not desire to be overvalued as a gem, nor to be undervalued as a mere stone."},{chapter:40,content:"Retirement is characteristic of Tao just as weakness appears to be a characteristic of its activity.\n\nHeaven and earth and everything are produced from existence, but existence comes from nonexistence. . . ."},{chapter:41,content:"The superior scholar when he considers Tao earnestly practices it; an average scholar listening to Tao sometimes follows it and sometimes loses it; an inferior scholar listening to Tao ridicules it. Were it not thus ridiculed it could not be regarded as Tao.\n\nTherefore the writer says: Those who are most illumined by Tao are the most obscure. Those advanced in Tao are most retiring. Those best guided by Tao are the least prepossessing.\n\nThe high in virtue (teh) resemble a lowly valley; the whitest are most likely to be put to shame; the broadest in virtue resemble the inefficient. The most firmly established in virtue resemble the remiss. The simplest chastity resembles the fickle, the greatest square has no corner, the largest vessel is never filled. The greatest sound is void of speech, the greatest form has no shape. Tao is obscure and without name, and yet it is precisely this Tao that alone can give and complete."},{chapter:42,content:"Tao produces unity; unity produces duality; duality produces trinity; trinity produces all things. All things bear the negative principle (yin) and embrace the positive principle (yang). Immaterial vitality, the third principle (chi), makes them harmonious.\n\nThose things which are detested by the common people, namely to be called orphans, inferiors, and unworthies, are the very things kings and lords take for titles. There are some things which it is a gain to lose, and a loss to gain.\n\nI am teaching the same things which are taught by others. But the strong and aggressive: ones do not obtain a natural death (i.e., self-confident teachers do not succeed). I alone expound the basis of the doctrine of the Tao."},{chapter:43,content:"The most tender things of creation race over the hardest.\n\nA non-material existence enters into the most impenetrable.\n\nI therefore recognize an advantage in the doctrine of not doing (wu wei) and not speaking. But there are few in the world who obtain the advantage of non-assertion (wu wei) and silence."},{chapter:44,content:"Which is nearer, a name or a person? Which is more, personality or treasure? Is it more painful to gain or to suffer loss?\n\nExtreme indulgence certainly greatly wastes. Much hoarding certainly invites severe loss.\n\nA contented person is not despised. One who knows when to stop is not endangered; he will be able therefore to continue."},{chapter:45,content:"Extreme perfection seems imperfect, its function is not exhausted. Extreme fullness appears empty, its function is not exercised.\n\nExtreme straightness appears crooked; great skill, clumsy; great eloquence, stammering. Motion conquers cold, quietude conquers heat. Not greatness but purity and clearness are the world's standard."},{chapter:46,content:"When the world yields to Tao, race horses will be used to haul manure. When the world ignores Tao war horses are pastured on the public common.\n\nThere is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness.\n\nTherefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content."},{chapter:47,content:"Not going out of the door I have knowledge of the world. Not peeping through the window I perceive heaven's Tao. The more one wanders to a distance the less he knows.\n\nTherefore the wise man does not wander about but he understands, he does not see things but he defines them, he does not labor yet he completes."},{chapter:48,content:"He who attends daily to learning increases in learning. He who practices Tao daily diminishes. Again and again he humbles himself. Thus he attains to non-doing (wu wei). He practices non-doing and yet there is nothing left undone.\n\nTo command the empire one must not employ craft. If one uses craft he is not fit to command the empire."},{chapter:49,content:"The wise man has no fixed heart; in the hearts of the people he finds his own. The good he treats with goodness; the not-good he also treats with goodness, for teh is goodness. The faithful ones he treats with good faith; the unfaithful he also treats with good faith, for teh is good faith.\n\nThe wise man lives in the world but he lives cautiously, dealing with the world cautiously. He universalizes his heart; the people give him their eyes and ears, but he treats them as his children."},{chapter:50,content:"Life is a going forth; death is a returning home. Of ten, three are seeking life, three are seeking death, and three are dying. What is the reason? Because they live in life's experience. (Only one is immortal.)\n\nI hear it said that the sage when he travels is never attacked by rhinoceros or tiger, and when coming among soldiers does not fear their weapons. The rhinoceros would find no place to horn him, nor the tiger a place for his claws, nor could soldiers wound him. What is the reason? Because he is invulnerable."},{chapter:51,content:"When creation began, Tao became the world's mother. When one knows one's mother he will m turn know that he is her son. When he recognizes his sonship, he will in turn keep to his mother and to the end of life will be free from danger.\n\nHe who closes his mouth and shuts his sense gates will be free from trouble to the end of life. He who opens his mouth and meddles with affairs cannot be free from trouble even to the end of life.\n\nTo recognize one's insignificance is called enlightenment. To keep one's sympathy is called strength. He who uses Tao's light returns to Tao's enlightenment and does not surrender his person to perdition. This is called practicing the eternal."},{chapter:52,content:"Even if one has but a little knowledge he can walk in the ways of the great Tao; it is only self-assertion that one need fear.\n\nThe great Tao (Way) is very plain, but people prefer the bypaths. When the palace is very splendid, the fields are likely to be very weedy, and the granaries empty. To wear ornaments and gay colors, to carry sharp swords, to be excessive in eating and drinking, and to have wealth and treasure in abundance is to know the pride of robbers. This is contrary to Tao."},{chapter:53,content:"The thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted. The thing that is well guarded is not easily taken away. If one has sons and grandsons, the offering of ancestral worship will not soon cease.\n\nHe who practices Tao in his person shows that his teh is real. The family that practices it shows that their teh is abounding. The township that practices it shows that their teh is enduring. The state that practices it shows that their teh is prolific. The empire that practices it reveals that teh is universal. Thereby one person becomes a test of other persons, one family of other families, one town of other towns, one county of other counties, and one empire of all empires.\n\nHow do I know that this test is universal? By this same Tao."},{chapter:54,content:"The essence of teh is comparable to the state of a young boy. Poisonous insects will not sting him, wild beasts will not seize him, birds of prey will not attack him. The bones are weak, the muscles are tender, it is true, but his grasp is firm.\n\nHe does not yet know the relation of the sexes, but he has perfect organs, nevertheless. His spirit is virile, indeed! He can sob and cry all day without becoming hoarse, his harmony (as a child) is perfect indeed!\n\nTo recognize this harmony (for growth) is to know the eternal'. To recognize the eternal is to know enlightenment. To increase life (to cause things to grow) is to know blessedness. To be conscious of an inner fecundity is strength. Things fully grown are about to decay, they are the opposite of Tao. The opposite of Tao soon ceases."},{chapter:55,content:"The one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know. The wise man shuts his mouth and closes his gates. He softens his sharpness, unravels his tangles, dims his brilliancy, and reckons himself with the mysterious.\n\nHe is inaccessible to favor or hate; he cannot be reached by profit or injury; he cannot be honored or humiliated. Thereby he is honored by all."},{chapter:56,content:"The empire is administered with righteousness; the army is directed by craft; the people are captivated by non-diplomacy. How do I know it is so? By this same Tao.\n\nAmong people the more restrictions and prohibitions there are, the poorer they become. The more people have weapons, the more the state is in confusion. The more people are artful and cunning the more abnormal things occur. The more laws and orders are issued the more thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTherefore the wise man says: If a ruler practices wu wei the people will reform of themselves. If I love quietude the people will of themselves become righteous. If I avoid profit-making the people will of themselves become prosperous. If I limit my desires the people will of themselves become simple."},{chapter:57,content:"When an administration is unostentatious the people are simple. When an administration is inquisitive, the people are needy. Misery, alas, supports happiness. Happiness, alas, conceals misery. Who knows its limits? It never ceases. The normal becomes the abnormal. The good in turn becomes unlucky. The people's confusion is felt daily for a long time.\n\nTherefore the wise man is square, yet does not injure, he is angular but does not annoy. He is upright but is not cross. He is bright but not glaring."},{chapter:58,content:"In governing the people and in worshipping heaven nothing surpasses moderation. To value moderation, one must form the habit early. Its early acquisition will result in storing and accumulating vitality. By storing and accumulating vitality nothing is impossible.\n\nIf nothing is impossible then one is ignorant of his limits. If one does not know his limitations, one may possess the state. He who possesses moderation is thereby lasting and enduring. It is like having deep roots and a strong stem. This is of long life and enduring insight the Tao (way)."},{chapter:59,content:"One should govern a great state as one fries small fish (i.e., do not scale or clean them).\n\nWith Tao one may successfully rule the Empire. Ghosts will not frighten, gods will not harm, neither will wise men mislead the people. Since nothing frightens or harms the people, teh will abide."},{chapter:60,content:"A great state that is useful is like a bond of unity within the Empire; it is the Empire's wife.\n\nThe female controls the male by her quietude and submission. Thus a great state by its service to smaller states wins their allegiance. A small state by submission to a great state wins an influence over them. Thus some stoop to conquer, and others stoop and conquer.\n\nGreat states can have no higher purpose than to federate states and feed the people. Small states can have no higher purpose than to enter a federation and serve the people. Both alike, each in his own way, gain their end, but to do so, the greater must practice humility."},{chapter:61,content:"The Tao is the asylum of all things; the good man's treasure, the bad man's last resort. With beautiful words one may sell goods but in winning people one can accomplish more by kindness. Why should a man be thrown away for his evil? To conserve him was the Emperor appointed and the three ministers.\n\nBetter than being in the presence of the Emperor and riding with four horses, is sitting and explaining this Tao.\n\nThe reason the Ancients esteemed Tao was because if sought it was obtained, and because by it he that hath sin could be saved. Is it not so? Therefore the world honors Tao."},{chapter:62,content:"One should avoid assertion (wu wei) and practice inaction. One should learn to find taste in the tasteless, to enlarge the small things, and multiply the few. He should respond to hatred with kindness. He should resolve a difficulty while it is easy, and manage a great thing while it is small. Surely all the world's difficulties arose from slight causes, and all the world's great affairs had small beginnings.\n\nTherefore the wise man avoids to the end participation in great affairs and by so doing establishes his greatness.\n\nRash promises are lacking in faith and many things that appear easy are full of difficulties. Therefore the wise man considers every thing difficult and so to the end he has no difficulties."},{chapter:63,content:"That which is at rest is easily restrained, that which has not yet appeared is easily prevented. The weak is easily broken, the scanty is easily scattered. Consider a difficulty before it arises, and administer affairs before they become disorganized. A tree that it takes both arms to encircle grew from a tiny rootlet. A pagoda of nine stories was erected by placing small bricks. A journey of three thousand miles begins with one step. If one tries to improve a thing, he mars it; if he seizes it, he loses it. The wise man, therefore, not attempting to form things does not mar them, and not grasping after things he does not lose them. The people in their rush for business are ever approaching success but continually failing. One must be as careful to the end as at the beginning if he is to succeed.\n\nTherefore the wise man desires to be free from desire, he does not value the things that are difficult of attainment. He learns to be unlearned, he returns to that which all others ignore. In that spirit he helps all things toward their natural development, but dares not interfere."},{chapter:64,content:"In the olden days those who obeyed the spirit of Tao did not enlighten the people but kept them simple hearted.\n\nThe reason people are difficult to govern is because of their smartness; likewise to govern a people with guile is a curse; and to govern them with simplicity is a blessing. He who remembers these two things is a model ruler. Always to follow this standard and rule is teh, the profound.\n\nProfound teh is deep indeed and far reaching. The very opposite of common things, but by it one obtains obedient subjects."},{chapter:65,content:"The reason rivers and seas are called the kings of the valley is because they keep below them.\n\nTherefore the wise man desiring to be above his people must in his demeanor keep below them; wishing to benefit his people, he must ever keep himself out of sight.\n\nThe wise man dwells above, yet the people do not feel the burden; he is the leader and the people suffer no harm. Therefore the world rejoices to exalt him and never wearies of him.\n\nBecause he will not quarrel with anyone, no one can quarrel with him."},{chapter:66,content:"All the world calls Tao great, yet it is by nature immaterial. It is because a thing is seemingly unreal that it is great. If a man affects to be great, how long can he conceal his mediocrity?\n\nTao has three treasures which he guards and cherishes. The first is called compassion; the second is called economy; the third is called humility. A man that is compassionate can 'be truly brave; if a man is economical he can be generous; if he is humble he can become a useful servant.\n\nIf one discards compassion and is still brave, abandons economy and is still generous, forsakes humility and still seeks to be serviceable, his days are numbered. On the contrary if one is truly compassionate, in battle he will be a conqueror and in defence he will be secure. When even Heaven helps people it is because of compassion that she does so."},{chapter:67,content:"He who excels as a soldier is the one who is not warlike; he who fights the best fight is not wrathful; he who best conquers an enemy is not quarrelsome; he who best employs people is obedient himself.\n\nThis is the virtue of not-quarreling, this is the secret of bringing out other men's ability, this is complying with Heaven. Since of old it is considered the greatest virtue (teh)."},{chapter:68,content:"A military expert has said: I do not dare put myself forward as a host, but always act as a guest. I hesitate to advance an inch, but am willing to withdraw a foot.\n\nThis is advancing by not advancing, it is winning without arms, it is charging without hostility, it is seizing without weapons. There is no mistake greater than making light of an enemy. By making light of an enemy we lose our treasure.\n\nTherefore when well-matched armies come to conflict, the one who is conscious of his weakness conquers."},{chapter:69,content:"My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet in all the world no one appears to understand them or to practice them.\n\nWords have an ancestor (a preceding idea), deeds have a master (a preceding purpose), and just as these are often not understood, so I am not understood.\n\nThey who understand me are very few, and on that account I am worthy of honor. The wise man wears wool (rather than silk) and keeps his gems out of sight."},{chapter:70,content:"To recognize one's ignorance of unknowable things is mental health, and to be ignorant of knowable things is sickness. Only by grieving over ignorance of knowable things are we in mental health. The wise man is wise because he understands his ignorance and is grieved over it."},{chapter:71,content:"When people are too ignorant to fear the fearsome thing, then it will surely come. Do not make the place where they dwell confining, the life they live wearisome. If they are let alone, they will not become restless. Therefore the wise man while not understanding himself regards himself, while cherishing he does not overvalue himself. Therefore he discards flattery and prefers regard."},{chapter:72,content:"Courage carried to daring leads to death. Courage restrained by caution leads to life. These two things, courage and caution, are sometimes beneficial and sometimes harmful. Some things are rejected by heaven, who can tell the reason? Therefore the wise man deems all acting difficult.\n\nThe Tao of heaven does not quarrel, yet it conquers. It speaks not, yet its response is good. It issues no summons but things come to it naturally because its devices are good. Heaven's net is vast, indeed! its meshes are wide but it loses nothing."},{chapter:73,content:"If the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death? If we teach people to fear death, then when one rebels he can be seized and executed; after that who will dare to rebel?\n\nThere is always an officer to execute a murderer, but if one takes the place of the executioner, it is like taking the place of a skilled carpenter at his hewing. If one takes the place of the skilled carpenter he is liable to cut himself. (Therefore do not interfere with Tao.)"},{chapter:74,content:"Starvation of a people comes when an official appropriates to himself too much of the taxes. The reason a people are difficult to govern is because the officials are too meddlesome; the people make light of death because they are so absorbed in life's interests. The one who is not absorbed in life is more moral than he who esteems life."},{chapter:75,content:"When a man is living he is tender and fragile. When he dies he is hard and stiff. It is the same with everything, the grass and trees, in life, are tender and delicate, but when they die they become rigid and dry.\n\nTherefore those who are hard and stiff belong to death's domain, while the tender and weak belong to the realm of life.\n\nTherefore soldiers are most invincible when they will not conquer. When a tree is grown to its greatest strength it is doomed. The strong and the great stay below; the tender and weak rise above."},{chapter:76,content:"Tao of heaven resembles the stretching of a bow. The mighty it humbles, the lowly it exalts. They who have abundance it diminishes and gives to them who have need.\n\nThat is Tao of heaven; it depletes those who abound, and completes those who lack.\n\nThe human way is not so. Men take from those who lack to give to those who already abound. Where is the man who by his abundance can best serve the world?\n\nThe wise man makes but claims not, he accomplishes merit, yet is not attached to it, neither does he display his excellence. Is it not so?"},{chapter:77,content:"In the world nothing is more fragile than water, and yet of all the agencies that attack hard substances nothing can surpass it.\n\nOf all things there is nothing that can take the place of Tao. By it the weak are conquerors of the strong, the pliable are conquerors of the rigid. In the world every one knows this, but none practice it.\n\nTherefore the wise man declares: he who is guilty of the country's sin may be the priest at the altar. He who is to blame for the country's misfortunes, is often the Empire's Sovereign. True words are often paradoxical."},{chapter:78,content:"When reconciling great hatred there will some remain. How can it be made good?\n\nTherefore the wise man accepts the debit side of the account and does not have to enforce payment from others. They who have virtue (teh) keep their obligations, they who have no virtue insist on their rights. Tao of heaven has no favorites but always helps the good man."},{chapter:79,content:"Faithful words are often not pleasant; pleasant words are often not faithful. Good men do not dispute; the ones who dispute are not good. The learned men are often not the wise men, nor the wise men, the learned. The wise man does not hoard, but ever working for others, he will the more exceedingly acquire. Having given to others freely, he himself will have in plenty. Tao of heaven benefits but does not injure. The wise man's Tao leads him to act but not to quarrel."}]}],It=function(e){var n=e.selectTranslation,t=e.currentTranslation;return(0,rt.jsx)("div",{className:"names",children:kt.map((function(e,o){return(0,rt.jsx)("button",{className:vt("names-btn",t===o&&"names-btn--current"),onClick:function(){return n(o)},children:e.name},o)}))})},At=function(){function n(e){"r"===e.key&&function(){for(var e="1\n\nThe Tao that can be understood cannot be the primal, or cosmic, Tao, just as an idea that can be expressed in words cannot be the infinite idea.\n\nAnd yet this ineffable Tao was the source of all spirit and matter, and being expressed was the mother of all created things.\n\nTherefore not to desire the things of sense is to know the freedom of spirituality; and to desire is to learn the limitation of matter. These two things spirit and matter, so different in nature, have the same origin. This unity of origin is the mystery of mysteries, but it is the gateway to spirituality.\n\n\n2\n\nWhen every one recognizes beauty to be only a masquerade, then it is simply ugliness. In the same way goodness, if it is not sincere, is not goodness. So existence and non-existence are incompatible. The difficult and easy are mutually opposites. Just as the long and the short, the high and the low, the loud and soft, the before and the behind, are all opposites and each reveals the other.\n\nTherefore the wise man is not conspicuous in his affairs or given to much talking. Though troubles arise he is not irritated. He produces but does not own; he acts but claims no merit; he builds but does not dwell therein; and because he does not dwell therein he never departs.\n\n\n3\n\nNeglecting to praise the worthy deters people from emulating them; just as not prizing rare treasures deters a man from becoming a thief; or ignoring the things which awaken desire keeps the heart at rest.\n\nTherefore the wise ruler does not suggest unnecessary things, but seeks to satisfy the minds of his people. He seeks to allay appetites but strengthen bones. He ever tries by keeping people in ignorance to keep them satisfied and those who have knowledge he restrains from evil. If he, himself, practices restraint then everything is in quietness.\n\n\n4\n\nThe Tao appears to be emptiness but it is never exhausted. Oh, it is profound! It appears to have preceded everything. It dulls its own sharpness, unravels its own fetters, softens its own brightness, identifies itself with its own dust.\n\nOh, it is tranquil! It appears infinite; I do not know from what it proceeds. It even appears to be antecedent to the Lord.\n\n\n5\n\nHeaven and earth are not like humans, they are impartial. They regard all things as insignificant, as though they were playthings made of straw. The wise man is also impartial. To him all men are alike and unimportant. The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows, it is empty but does not collapse; it moves and more and more issues. A gossip is soon empty, it is doubtful if he can be impartial.\n\n\n6\n\nThe Spirit of the perennial spring is said to be immortal, she is called the Mysterious One. The Mysterious One is typical of the source of heaven and earth. It is continually and endlessly issuing and without effort.\n\n\n7\n\nHeaven is eternal, earth is lasting. The reason why heaven and earth are eternal and lasting is because they do not live for themselves; that is the reason they will ever endure.\n\nTherefore the wise man will keep his personality out of sight and because of so doing he will become notable. He subordinates his personality and therefore it is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he is disinterested, that his own interests are conserved?\n\n\n8\n\nTrue goodness is like water, in that it benefits everything and harms nothing. Like water it ever seeks the lowest place, the place that all others avoid. It is closely kin to the Tao.\n\nFor a dwelling it chooses the quiet meadow; for a heart the circling eddy. In generosity it is kind; in speech it is sincere; in authority it is order; in affairs it is ability; in movement it is rhythm.\n\nInasmuch as it is always peaceable it is never rebuked.\n\n\n9\n\nContinuing to fill a pail after it is full the water will be wasted. Continuing to grind an axe after it is sharp will soon wear it away.\n\nWho can protect a public hall crowded with gold and jewels? The pride of wealth and position brings about their own misfortune. To win true merit, to preserve just fame, the personality must be retiring. This is the heavenly Tao.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nBy patience the animal spirits can be disciplined. By self-control one can unify the character. By close attention to the will, compelling gentleness, one can become like a little child. By purifying the subconscious desires one may be without fault. In ruling his country, if the wise magistrate loves his people, he can avoid compulsion.\n\nIn measuring out rewards, the wise magistrate will act like a mother bird. While sharply penetrating into every corner, he may appear to be unsuspecting. While quickening and feeding his people, he will be producing but without pride of ownership. He will benefit but without claim of reward. He will persuade, but not compel by force. This is teh, the profoundest virtue.\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nAlthough the wheel has thirty spokes its utility lies in the emptiness of the hub. The jar is made by kneading clay, but its usefulness consists in its capacity. A room is made by cutting out windows and doors through the walls, but the space the walls contain measures the room's value.\n\nIn the same way matter is necessary to form, but the value of reality lies in its immateriality.\n\n(Or thus: a material body is necessary to existence, but the value of a life is measured by its immaterial soul.)\n\n\n12\n\n\n\nAn excess of light blinds the human eye; an excess of noise ruins the ear; an excess of condiments deadens the taste. The effect of too much horse racing and hunting is bad, and the lure of hidden treasure tempts one to do evil.\n\nTherefore the wise man attends to the inner significance of things and does not concern himself with outward appearances. Therefore he ignores matter and seeks the spirit.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\nFavor and disgrace are alike to be feared, just as too great care or anxiety are bad for the body.\n\nWhy are favor and disgrace alike to be feared? To be favored is humiliating; to obtain it is as much to be dreaded as to lose it. To lose favor is to be in disgrace and of course is to be dreaded.\n\nWhy are excessive care and great anxiety alike bad for one? The very reason I have anxiety is because I have a body. If I have not body why would I be anxious?\n\nTherefore if he who administers the empire, esteems it as his own body, then he is worthy to be trusted with the empire.\n\n\n14\n\n\n\nIt is unseen because it is colorless; it is unheard because it is soundless; when seeking to grasp it, it eludes one, because it is incorporeal.\n\nBecause of these qualities it cannot be examined, and yet they form an essential unity. Superficially it appears abstruse, but in its depths it is not obscure. It has been nameless forever! It appears and then disappears. It is what is known as the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. It is called the transcendental, its face (or destiny) cannot be seen in front, or its back (or origin) behind.\n\nBut by holding fast to the Tao of the ancients, the wise man may understand the present, because he knows the origin of the past. This is the clue to the Tao.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\nIn olden times the ones who were considered worthy to be called masters were subtle, spiritual, profound, wise. Their thoughts could not be easily understood.\n\nSince they were hard to understand I will try to make them clear. They were cautious like men wading a river in winter. They were reluctant like men who feared their neighbors. They were reserved like guests in the presence of their host. They were elusive like ice at the point of melting. They were like unseasoned wood. They were like a valley between high mountains. They were obscure like troubled waters. (They were cautious because they were conscious of the deeper meanings of life and its possibilities.)\n\nWe can clarify troubled waters by slowly quieting them. We can bring the unconscious to life by slowly moving them. But he who has the secret of the Tao does not desire for more. Being content, he is able to mature without desire to be newly fashioned.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nSeek to attain an open mind (the summit of vacuity). Seek composure (the essence of tranquillity).\n\nAll things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquillity; it is moving towards its destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.\n\nKnowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; nobility is like heaven.\n\nThe heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is not to be feared.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\nWhen great men rule, subjects know little of their existence. Rulers who are less great win the affection and praise of their subjects. A common ruler is feared by his subjects, and an unworthy ruler is despised.\n\nWhen a ruler lacks faith, you may seek in vain for it among his subjects.\n\nHow carefully a wise ruler chooses his words. He performs deeds, and accumulates merit! Under such a ruler the people think they are ruling themselves.\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nWhen the great Tao is lost sight of, we still have the idea of benevolence and righteousness. Prudence and wisdom come to mind when we see great hypocrisy. When relatives are! unfriendly, we still have the teachings of filial piety and paternal affection. When the state and the clan are in confusion and disorder, we still have the ideals of loyalty and faithfulness.\n\n\n19\n\n\n\nAbandon the show of saintliness and relinquish excessive prudence, then people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon ostentatious benevolence and conspicuous righteousness, then people will return to the primal virtues of filial piety and parental affection. Abandon cleverness and relinquish gains, then thieves and robbers will disappear.\n\nHere are three fundamentals on which to depend, wherein culture is insufficient. Therefore let all men hold to that which is reliable, namely, recognize simplicity, cherish purity, reduce one's possessions, diminish one's desires.\n\n\n20\n\n\n\nAvoid learning if you would have no anxiety. The \"yes\" and the \"yea\" differ very little, but the contrast between good and evil is very great. That which is not feared by the people is not worth fearing. But, oh, the difference, the desolation, the vastness, between ignorance and the limitless expression of the Tao.\n\n(The balance of this sonnet is devoted to showing the difference between the careless state of the common people and his own vision of the Tao. It is one of the most pathetic expressions of human loneliness, from lack of appreciation, ever written. It is omitted here that it might serve for the closing sonnet and valedictory.)\n\n\n21\n\n\n\nAll the innumerable forms of teh correspond to the norm of Tao, but the nature of the Tao's activity is infinitely abstract and illusive. Illusive and obscure, indeed, but at its heart are forms and types. Vague and illusive, indeed, but at its heart is all being. Unfathomable and obscure, indeed, but at its heart is all spirit, and spirit is reality. At its heart is truth.\n\nFrom of old its expression is unceasing, it has been present at all beginnings. How do I know that its nature is thus? By this same Tao.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\nAt that time the deficient will be made perfect; the distorted will be straightened; the empty will be filled; the worn out will be renewed; those having little will obtain and those having much will be overcome.\n\nTherefore the wise man, embracing unity as he does, will become the world's model. Not pushing himself forward he will become enlightened; not asserting himself he will become distinguished; not boasting of himself he will acquire merit; not approving himself he will endure. Forasmuch as he will not quarrel, the world will not quarrel with him.\n\nIs the old saying, \"The crooked shall be made straight,\" a false saying? Indeed, no! They will be perfected and return rejoicing.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\nTaciturnity is natural to man. A whirlwind never outlasts the morning, nor a violent rain the day. What is the cause? It is heaven and earth. If even heaven and earth are not constant, much less can man be.\n\nTherefore he who pursues his affairs in the spirit of Tao will become Tao-like. He who pursues his affairs with teh, will become teh-like. He who pursues his affairs with loss, identifies himself with loss.\n\nHe who identifies himself with Tao, Tao rejoices to guide. He who identifies himself with teh, teh rejoices to reward. And he who identifies himself with loss, loss rejoices to ruin.\n\nIf his faith fail, he will receive no reward of faith.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\nIt is not natural to stand on tiptoe, or being astride one does not walk. One who displays himself is not bright, or one who asserts himself cannot shine. A self-approving man has no merit, nor does one who praises himself grow.\n\nThe relation of these things (self-display, self-assertion, self-approval) to Tao is the same as offal is to food. They are excrescences from the system; they are detestable; Tao does not dwell in them.\n\n\n25\n\n\n\nThere is Being that is all-inclusive and that existed before Heaven and Earth. Calm, indeed, and incorporeal! It is alone and changeless!\n\nEverywhere it functions unhindered. It thereby becomes the world's mother. I do not know its nature; if I try to characterize it, I will call it Tao.\n\nIf forced to give it a name, I will call it the Great. The Great is evasive, the evasive is the distant, the distant is ever coming near. Tao is Great. So is Heaven great, and so is Earth and so also is the representative of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMan is derived from nature, nature is derived from Heaven, Heaven is derived from Tao. Tao is self-derived.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light; the quiet is master of motion. Therefore the wise man in all the experience of the day will not depart from dignity. Though he be surrounded with sights that are magnificent, he will remain calm and unconcerned.\n\nHow does it come to pass that the Emperor, master of ten thousand chariots, has lost the mastery of the Empire? Because being flippant himself, he has lost the respect of his subjects; being passionate himself, he has lost the control of the Empire.\n\n\n27\n\n\n\nGood walkers leave no tracks, good speakers make no errors, good counters need no abacus, good wardens have no need for bolts and locks for no one can get by them. Good binders can dispense with rope and cord, yet none can unloose their hold.\n\nTherefore the wise man trusting in goodness always saves men, for there is no outcast to him. Trusting in goodness he saves all things for there is nothing valueless to him. This is recognizing concealed values.\n\nTherefore the good man is the instructor of the evil man, and the evil man is the good man's wealth. He who does not esteem his instructors or value his wealth, though he be otherwise intelligent, becomes confused. Herein lies the significance of spirituality.\n\n\n28\n\n\n\nHe who knows his manhood and understands his womanhood becomes useful like the valleys of earth (which bring water). Being like the valleys of earth, eternal vitality (teh) will not depart from him, he will come again to the nature of a little child.\n\nHe who knows his innocence and recognizes his sin becomes the world's model. Being a world's model, infinite teh will not fail, he will return to the Absolute.\n\nHe who knows the glory of his nature and recognizes also his limitations becomes useful like the world's valleys. Being like the world's valleys, eternal teh will not fail him, he will revert to simplicity.\n\nRadiating simplicity he will make of men vessels of usefulness. The wise man then will employ them as officials and chiefs. A great administration of such will harm no one.\n\n\n29\n\n\n\nOne who desires to take and remake the Empire will fail. The Empire is a divine thing that cannot be remade. He who attempts it will only mar it.\n\nHe who seeks to grasp it, will lose it. People differ, some lead, others follow; some are ardent, others are formal; some are strong, others weak; some succeed, others fail. Therefore the wise man practices moderation; he abandons pleasure, extravagance and indulgence.\n\n\n30\n\n\n\nWhen the magistrate follows Tao, he has no need to resort to force of arms to strengthen the Empire, because his business methods alone will show good returns.\n\nBriars and thorns grow rank where an army camps. Bad harvests are the sequence of a great war. The good ruler will be resolute and then stop, he dare not take by force. One should be resolute but not boastful; resolute but not haughty; resolute but not arrogant; resolute but yielding when it cannot be avoided; resolute but he must not resort to violence.\n\nBy a resort to force, things flourish for a time but then decay. This is not like the Tao and that which is not Tao-like will soon cease.\n\n\n31\n\n\n\nEven successful arms, among all implements, are unblessed. All men come to detest them. Therefore the one who follows Tao does not rely on them. Arms are of all tools unblessed, they are not the implements of a wise man. Only as a last resort does he use them.\n\nPeace and quietude are esteemed by the wise man, and even when victorious he does not rejoice, because rejoicing over a victory is the same as rejoicing over the killing of men. If he rejoices over killing men, do you think he will ever really master the Empire?\n\nIn propitious affairs the place of honor is the left, but in unpropitious affairs we honor the right.\n\nThe strong man while at home esteems the left as the place of honor, but when armed for war it is as though he esteems the right hand, the place of less honor.\n\nThus a funeral ceremony is so arranged. The place of a subordinate army officer is also on the left and the place of his superior officer is on the right. The killing of men fills multitudes with sorrow; we lament with tears because of it, and rightly honor the victor as if he was attending a funeral ceremony.\n\n\n32\n\n\n\nTao in its eternal aspect is unnamable. Its simplicity appears insignificant, but the whole world cannot control it. If princes and kings employ it every one of themselves will pay willing homage. Heaven and Earth by it are harmoniously combined and drop sweet dew. People will have no need of rulers, because of themselves they will be righteous.\n\nAs soon as Tao expresses itself in orderly creation then it becomes comprehensible. When one recognizes the presence of Tao he understands where to stop. Knowing where to stop he is free from danger.\n\nTo illustrate the nature of Tao's place in the universe: Tao is like the brooks and streams in their relation to the great rivers and the ocean.\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nHe who knows others is intelligent; he who understands himself is enlightened; he who is able to conquer others has force, but he who is able to control himself is mighty. He who appreciates contentment is wealthy.\n\nHe who dares to act has nerve; if he can maintain his position he will endure, but he, who dying does not perish, is immortal.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\nGreat Tao is all pervading! It can be on both the right hand and the left. Everything relies upon it for their existence, and it does not fail them. It acquires merit but covets not the title. It lovingly nourishes everything, but does not claim the rights of ownership. It has no desires, it can be classed with the small. Everything returns to it, yet it does not claim the right of ownership. It can be classed with the great.\n\nTherefore the wise man to the end will not pose as a great man, and by so doing will express his true greatness.\n\n\n35\n\n\n\nThe world will go to him who grasps this Great Principle; they will seek and not be injured, they will find contentment, peace and rest.\n\nMusic and dainties attract the passing people, while Tao's reality seen-is insipid. Indeed it has no taste, when looked at there is not enough seen to be prized, when listened for, it can scarcely be heard, but, the use of it is inexhaustible.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\nThat which has a tendency to contract must first have been extended; that which has a tendency to weaken itself must first have been strong; that which shows a tendency to destroy itself must first have been raised up; that which shows a tendency to scatter must first have been gathered.\n\nThis is the explanation of a seeming contradiction: the tender and yielding conquer the rigid and strong (i.e., spirit is stronger than matter, persuasion than force). The fish would be foolish to seek escape from its natural environment. There is no gain to a nation to compel by a show of force.\n\n\n37\n\n\n\nTao is apparently inactive (wu wei) and yet nothing remains undone. If princes and kings desire to keep) everything in order, they must first reform themselves. (If princes and kings would follow the example of Tao, then all things will reform themselves.) If they still desire to change, I would pacify them by the simplicity of the ineffable Tao.\n\nThis simplicity will end desire, and if desire be absent there is quietness. All people will of themselves be satisfied.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\nEssential teh makes no show of virtue, and therefore it is really virtuous. Inferior virtue never loses sight of itself and therefore it is no longer virtue. Essential virtue is characterized by lack of self-assertion (wu wei) and therefore is unpretentious. Inferior virtue is acting a part and thereby is only pretense.\n\nSuperior benevolence in a way is acting but does not thereby become pretentious. Excessive righteousness is acting and does thereby become pretentious. Excessive propriety is acting, but where no one responds to it, it stretches its arm and enforces obedience.\n\nTherefore when one loses Tao there is still teh; one may lose teh and benevolence remains; one may forsake benevolence and still hold to righteousness; one may lose righteousness and propriety remains.\n\nPropriety, alone, reduces loyalty and good faith to a shadow, and it is the beginning of disorder. Tradition is the mere flower of the Tao and had its origin in ignorance.\n\nTherefore the great man of affairs conforms to the spirit and not to external appearance. He goes on to fruitage and does not rest in the show of blossom. He avoids mere propriety and practices true benevolence.\n\n\n39\n\n\n\nIt has been said of old, only those who attain unity attain self-hood. . . . Heaven attained unity and thereby is space. Earth attained unity, thereby it is solid. Spirit attained unity, thereby it became mind. Valleys attained unity, therefore rivers flow down them. All things have unity and thereby have life. Princes and kings as they attain unity become standards of conduct for the nation. And the highest unity is that which produces unity.\n\nIf heaven were not space it might crack, if earth were not solid it might bend. If spirits were not unified into mind they might vanish, if valleys were not adapted to rivers they would be parched. Everything if it were not for life would burn up. Even princes and kings if they overestimate themselves and cease to be standards will presumably fall.\n\nTherefore nobles find their roots among the commoners; the high is always founded upon the low. The reason why princes and kings speak of themselves as orphans, inferiors and unworthy, is because they recognize that their roots run down to the common life; is it not so?\n\nIf a carriage goes to pieces it is no longer a carriage, its unity is gone. A true self-hood does not desire to be overvalued as a gem, nor to be undervalued as a mere stone.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\nRetirement is characteristic of Tao just as weakness appears to be a characteristic of its activity.\n\nHeaven and earth and everything are produced from existence, but existence comes from nonexistence. . . .\n\n\n41\n\n\n\nThe superior scholar when he considers Tao earnestly practices it; an average scholar listening to Tao sometimes follows it and sometimes loses it; an inferior scholar listening to Tao ridicules it. Were it not thus ridiculed it could not be regarded as Tao.\n\nTherefore the writer says: Those who are most illumined by Tao are the most obscure. Those advanced in Tao are most retiring. Those best guided by Tao are the least prepossessing.\n\nThe high in virtue (teh) resemble a lowly valley; the whitest are most likely to be put to shame; the broadest in virtue resemble the inefficient. The most firmly established in virtue resemble the remiss. The simplest chastity resembles the fickle, the greatest square has no corner, the largest vessel is never filled. The greatest sound is void of speech, the greatest form has no shape. Tao is obscure and without name, and yet it is precisely this Tao that alone can give and complete.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\nTao produces unity; unity produces duality; duality produces trinity; trinity produces all things. All things bear the negative principle (yin) and embrace the positive principle (yang). Immaterial vitality, the third principle (chi), makes them harmonious.\n\nThose things which are detested by the common people, namely to be called orphans, inferiors, and unworthies, are the very things kings and lords take for titles. There are some things which it is a gain to lose, and a loss to gain.\n\nI am teaching the same things which are taught by others. But the strong and aggressive: ones do not obtain a natural death (i.e., self-confident teachers do not succeed). I alone expound the basis of the doctrine of the Tao.\n\n\n43\n\n\n\nThe most tender things of creation race over the hardest.\n\nA non-material existence enters into the most impenetrable.\n\nI therefore recognize an advantage in the doctrine of not doing (wu wei) and not speaking. But there are few in the world who obtain the advantage of non-assertion (wu wei) and silence.\n\n\n44\n\n\n\nWhich is nearer, a name or a person? Which is more, personality or treasure? Is it more painful to gain or to suffer loss?\n\nExtreme indulgence certainly greatly wastes. Much hoarding certainly invites severe loss.\n\nA contented person is not despised. One who knows when to stop is not endangered; he will be able therefore to continue.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\nExtreme perfection seems imperfect, its function is not exhausted. Extreme fullness appears empty, its function is not exercised.\n\nExtreme straightness appears crooked; great skill, clumsy; great eloquence, stammering. Motion conquers cold, quietude conquers heat. Not greatness but purity and clearness are the world's standard.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\nWhen the world yields to Tao, race horses will be used to haul manure. When the world ignores Tao war horses are pastured on the public common.\n\nThere is no sin greater than desire. There is no misfortune greater than discontent. There is no calamity greater than acquisitiveness.\n\nTherefore to know extreme contentment is simply to be content.\n\n\n47\n\n\n\nNot going out of the door I have knowledge of the world. Not peeping through the window I perceive heaven's Tao. The more one wanders to a distance the less he knows.\n\nTherefore the wise man does not wander about but he understands, he does not see things but he defines them, he does not labor yet he completes.\n\n\n48\n\n\n\nHe who attends daily to learning increases in learning. He who practices Tao daily diminishes. Again and again he humbles himself. Thus he attains to non-doing (wu wei). He practices non-doing and yet there is nothing left undone.\n\nTo command the empire one must not employ craft. If one uses craft he is not fit to command the empire.\n\n\n49\n\n\n\nThe wise man has no fixed heart; in the hearts of the people he finds his own. The good he treats with goodness; the not-good he also treats with goodness, for teh is goodness. The faithful ones he treats with good faith; the unfaithful he also treats with good faith, for teh is good faith.\n\nThe wise man lives in the world but he lives cautiously, dealing with the world cautiously. He universalizes his heart; the people give him their eyes and ears, but he treats them as his children.\n\n\n50\n\n\n\nLife is a going forth; death is a returning home. Of ten, three are seeking life, three are seeking death, and three are dying. What is the reason? Because they live in life's experience. (Only one is immortal.)\n\nI hear it said that the sage when he travels is never attacked by rhinoceros or tiger, and when coming among soldiers does not fear their weapons. The rhinoceros would find no place to horn him, nor the tiger a place for his claws, nor could soldiers wound him. What is the reason? Because he is invulnerable.\n\n\n51\n\n\n\nTao gives life to all creatures; teh feeds them; materiality shapes them; energy completes them. p. 37 Therefore among all things there is none that does not honor Tao and esteem teh. Honor for Tao and esteem for teh is never compelled, it is always spontaneous. Therefore Tao gives life to them, but teh nurses them, raises them, nurtures, completes, matures, rears, protects them.\n\nTao gives life to them but makes no claim of ownership; teh forms them but makes no claim upon them, raises them but does not rule them. This is profound vitality (teh).\n\n\n52\n\n\n\nWhen creation began, Tao became the world's mother. When one knows one's mother he will m turn know that he is her son. When he recognizes his sonship, he will in turn keep to his mother and to the end of life will be free from danger.\n\nHe who closes his mouth and shuts his sense gates will be free from trouble to the end of life. He who opens his mouth and meddles with affairs cannot be free from trouble even to the end of life.\n\nTo recognize one's insignificance is called enlightenment. To keep one's sympathy is called strength. He who uses Tao's light returns to Tao's enlightenment and does not surrender his person to perdition. This is called practicing the eternal.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\nEven if one has but a little knowledge he can walk in the ways of the great Tao; it is only self-assertion that one need fear.\n\nThe great Tao (Way) is very plain, but people prefer the bypaths. When the palace is very splendid, the fields are likely to be very weedy, and the granaries empty. To wear ornaments and gay colors, to carry sharp swords, to be excessive in eating and drinking, and to have wealth and treasure in abundance is to know the pride of robbers. This is contrary to Tao.\n\n\n54\n\n\n\nThe thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted. The thing that is well guarded is not easily taken away. If one has sons and grandsons, the offering of ancestral worship will not soon cease.\n\nHe who practices Tao in his person shows that his teh is real. The family that practices it shows that their teh is abounding. The township that practices it shows that their teh is enduring. The state that practices it shows that their teh is prolific. The empire that practices it reveals that teh is universal. Thereby one person becomes a test of other persons, one family of other families, one town of other towns, one county of other counties, and one empire of all empires.\n\nHow do I know that this test is universal? By this same Tao.\n\n\n55\n\n\n\nThe essence of teh is comparable to the state of a young boy. Poisonous insects will not sting him, wild beasts will not seize him, birds of prey will not attack him. The bones are weak, the muscles are tender, it is true, but his grasp is firm.\n\nHe does not yet know the relation of the sexes, but he has perfect organs, nevertheless. His spirit is virile, indeed! He can sob and cry all day without becoming hoarse, his harmony (as a child) is perfect indeed!\n\nTo recognize this harmony (for growth) is to know the eternal'. To recognize the eternal is to know enlightenment. To increase life (to cause things to grow) is to know blessedness. To be conscious of an inner fecundity is strength. Things fully grown are about to decay, they are the opposite of Tao. The opposite of Tao soon ceases.\n\n\n56\n\n\n\nThe one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know. The wise man shuts his mouth and closes his gates. He softens his sharpness, unravels his tangles, dims his brilliancy, and reckons himself with the mysterious.\n\nHe is inaccessible to favor or hate; he cannot be reached by profit or injury; he cannot be honored or humiliated. Thereby he is honored by all.\n\n\n57\n\n\n\nThe empire is administered with righteousness; the army is directed by craft; the people are captivated by non-diplomacy. How do I know it is so? By this same Tao.\n\nAmong people the more restrictions and prohibitions there are, the poorer they become. The more people have weapons, the more the state is in confusion. The more people are artful and cunning the more abnormal things occur. The more laws and orders are issued the more thieves and robbers abound.\n\nTherefore the wise man says: If a ruler practices wu wei the people will reform of themselves. If I love quietude the people will of themselves become righteous. If I avoid profit-making the people will of themselves become prosperous. If I limit my desires the people will of themselves become simple.\n\n\n58\n\n\n\nWhen an administration is unostentatious the people are simple. When an administration is inquisitive, the people are needy. Misery, alas, supports happiness. Happiness, alas, conceals misery. Who knows its limits? It never ceases. The normal becomes the abnormal. The good in turn becomes unlucky. The people's confusion is felt daily for a long time.\n\nTherefore the wise man is square, yet does not injure, he is angular but does not annoy. He is upright but is not cross. He is bright but not glaring.\n\n\n59\n\n\n\nIn governing the people and in worshipping heaven nothing surpasses moderation. To value moderation, one must form the habit early. Its early acquisition will result in storing and accumulating vitality. By storing and accumulating vitality nothing is impossible.\n\nIf nothing is impossible then one is ignorant of his limits. If one does not know his limitations, one may possess the state. He who possesses moderation is thereby lasting and enduring. It is like having deep roots and a strong stem. This is of long life and enduring insight the Tao (way).\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nOne should govern a great state as one fries small fish (i.e., do not scale or clean them).\n\nWith Tao one may successfully rule the Empire. Ghosts will not frighten, gods will not harm, neither will wise men mislead the people. Since nothing frightens or harms the people, teh will abide.\n\n\n61\n\n\n\nA great state that is useful is like a bond of unity within the Empire; it is the Empire's wife.\n\nThe female controls the male by her quietude and submission. Thus a great state by its service to smaller states wins their allegiance. A small state by submission to a great state wins an influence over them. Thus some stoop to conquer, and others stoop and conquer.\n\nGreat states can have no higher purpose than to federate states and feed the people. Small states can have no higher purpose than to enter a federation and serve the people. Both alike, each in his own way, gain their end, but to do so, the greater must practice humility.\n\n\n62\n\n\n\nThe Tao is the asylum of all things; the good man's treasure, the bad man's last resort. With beautiful words one may sell goods but in winning people one can accomplish more by kindness. Why should a man be thrown away for his evil? To conserve him was the Emperor appointed and the three ministers.\n\nBetter than being in the presence of the Emperor and riding with four horses, is sitting and explaining this Tao.\n\nThe reason the Ancients esteemed Tao was because if sought it was obtained, and because by it he that hath sin could be saved. Is it not so? Therefore the world honors Tao.\n\n\n63\n\n\n\nOne should avoid assertion (wu wei) and practice inaction. One should learn to find taste in the tasteless, to enlarge the small things, and multiply the few. He should respond to hatred with kindness. He should resolve a difficulty while it is easy, and manage a great thing while it is small. Surely all the world's difficulties arose from slight causes, and all the world's great affairs had small beginnings.\n\nTherefore the wise man avoids to the end participation in great affairs and by so doing establishes his greatness.\n\nRash promises are lacking in faith and many things that appear easy are full of difficulties. Therefore the wise man considers every thing difficult and so to the end he has no difficulties.\n\n\n64\n\n\n\nThat which is at rest is easily restrained, that which has not yet appeared is easily prevented. The weak is easily broken, the scanty is easily scattered. Consider a difficulty before it arises, and administer affairs before they become disorganized. A tree that it takes both arms to encircle grew from a tiny rootlet. A pagoda of nine stories was erected by placing small bricks. A journey of three thousand miles begins with one step. If one tries to improve a thing, he mars it; if he seizes it, he loses it. The wise man, therefore, not attempting to form things does not mar them, and not grasping after things he does not lose them. The people in their rush for business are ever approaching success but continually failing. One must be as careful to the end as at the beginning if he is to succeed.\n\nTherefore the wise man desires to be free from desire, he does not value the things that are difficult of attainment. He learns to be unlearned, he returns to that which all others ignore. In that spirit he helps all things toward their natural development, but dares not interfere.\n\n\n65\n\n\n\nIn the olden days those who obeyed the spirit of Tao did not enlighten the people but kept them simple hearted.\n\nThe reason people are difficult to govern is because of their smartness; likewise to govern a people with guile is a curse; and to govern them with simplicity is a blessing. He who remembers these two things is a model ruler. Always to follow this standard and rule is teh, the profound.\n\nProfound teh is deep indeed and far reaching. The very opposite of common things, but by it one obtains obedient subjects.\n\n\n66\n\n\n\nThe reason rivers and seas are called the kings of the valley is because they keep below them.\n\nTherefore the wise man desiring to be above his people must in his demeanor keep below them; wishing to benefit his people, he must ever keep himself out of sight.\n\nThe wise man dwells above, yet the people do not feel the burden; he is the leader and the people suffer no harm. Therefore the world rejoices to exalt him and never wearies of him.\n\nBecause he will not quarrel with anyone, no one can quarrel with him.\n\n\n67\n\n\n\nAll the world calls Tao great, yet it is by nature immaterial. It is because a thing is seemingly unreal that it is great. If a man affects to be great, how long can he conceal his mediocrity?\n\nTao has three treasures which he guards and cherishes. The first is called compassion; the second is called economy; the third is called humility. A man that is compassionate can 'be truly brave; if a man is economical he can be generous; if he is humble he can become a useful servant.\n\nIf one discards compassion and is still brave, abandons economy and is still generous, forsakes humility and still seeks to be serviceable, his days are numbered. On the contrary if one is truly compassionate, in battle he will be a conqueror and in defence he will be secure. When even Heaven helps people it is because of compassion that she does so.\n\n\n68\n\n\n\nHe who excels as a soldier is the one who is not warlike; he who fights the best fight is not wrathful; he who best conquers an enemy is not quarrelsome; he who best employs people is obedient himself.\n\nThis is the virtue of not-quarreling, this is the secret of bringing out other men's ability, this is complying with Heaven. Since of old it is considered the greatest virtue (teh).\n\n\n69\n\n\n\nA military expert has said: I do not dare put myself forward as a host, but always act as a guest. I hesitate to advance an inch, but am willing to withdraw a foot.\n\nThis is advancing by not advancing, it is winning without arms, it is charging without hostility, it is seizing without weapons. There is no mistake greater than making light of an enemy. By making light of an enemy we lose our treasure.\n\nTherefore when well-matched armies come to conflict, the one who is conscious of his weakness conquers.\n\n\n70\n\n\n\nMy words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet in all the world no one appears to understand them or to practice them.\n\nWords have an ancestor (a preceding idea), deeds have a master (a preceding purpose), and just as these are often not understood, so I am not understood.\n\nThey who understand me are very few, and on that account I am worthy of honor. The wise man wears wool (rather than silk) and keeps his gems out of sight.\n\n\n71\n\n\n\nTo recognize one's ignorance of unknowable things is mental health, and to be ignorant of knowable things is sickness. Only by grieving over ignorance of knowable things are we in mental health. The wise man is wise because he understands his ignorance and is grieved over it.\n\n\n72\n\n\n\nWhen people are too ignorant to fear the fearsome thing, then it will surely come. Do not make the place where they dwell confining, the life they live wearisome. If they are let alone, they will not become restless. Therefore the wise man while not understanding himself regards himself, while cherishing he does not overvalue himself. Therefore he discards flattery and prefers regard.\n\n\n73\n\n\n\nCourage carried to daring leads to death. Courage restrained by caution leads to life. These two things, courage and caution, are sometimes beneficial and sometimes harmful. Some things are rejected by heaven, who can tell the reason? Therefore the wise man deems all acting difficult.\n\nThe Tao of heaven does not quarrel, yet it conquers. It speaks not, yet its response is good. It issues no summons but things come to it naturally because its devices are good. Heaven's net is vast, indeed! its meshes are wide but it loses nothing.\n\n\n74\n\n\n\nIf the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death? If we teach people to fear death, then when one rebels he can be seized and executed; after that who will dare to rebel?\n\nThere is always an officer to execute a murderer, but if one takes the place of the executioner, it is like taking the place of a skilled carpenter at his hewing. If one takes the place of the skilled carpenter he is liable to cut himself. (Therefore do not interfere with Tao.)\n\n\n75\n\n\n\nStarvation of a people comes when an official appropriates to himself too much of the taxes. The reason a people are difficult to govern is because the officials are too meddlesome; the people make light of death because they are so absorbed in life's interests. The one who is not absorbed in life is more moral than he who esteems life.\n\n\n76\n\n\n\nWhen a man is living he is tender and fragile. When he dies he is hard and stiff. It is the same with everything, the grass and trees, in life, are tender and delicate, but when they die they become rigid and dry.\n\nTherefore those who are hard and stiff belong to death's domain, while the tender and weak belong to the realm of life.\n\nTherefore soldiers are most invincible when they will not conquer. When a tree is grown to its greatest strength it is doomed. The strong and the great stay below; the tender and weak rise above.\n\n\n77\n\n\n\nTao of heaven resembles the stretching of a bow. The mighty it humbles, the lowly it exalts. They who have abundance it diminishes and gives to them who have need.\n\nThat is Tao of heaven; it depletes those who abound, and completes those who lack.\n\nThe human way is not so. Men take from those who lack to give to those who already abound. Where is the man who by his abundance can best serve the world?\n\nThe wise man makes but claims not, he accomplishes merit, yet is not attached to it, neither does he display his excellence. Is it not so?\n\n\n78\n\n\n\nIn the world nothing is more fragile than water, and yet of all the agencies that attack hard substances nothing can surpass it.\n\nOf all things there is nothing that can take the place of Tao. By it the weak are conquerors of the strong, the pliable are conquerors of the rigid. In the world every one knows this, but none practice it.\n\nTherefore the wise man declares: he who is guilty of the country's sin may be the priest at the altar. He who is to blame for the country's misfortunes, is often the Empire's Sovereign. True words are often paradoxical.\n\n\n79\n\n\n\nWhen reconciling great hatred there will some remain. How can it be made good?\n\nTherefore the wise man accepts the debit side of the account and does not have to enforce payment from others. They who have virtue (teh) keep their obligations, they who have no virtue insist on their rights. Tao of heaven has no favorites but always helps the good man.\n\n\n80\n\n\n\nIn a small country with few people let there be officers over tens and hundreds but not to exercise power. Let the people be not afraid of death, nor desire to move to a distance. Then though there be ships and carriages, they will have no occasion to use them. Though there be armor and weapons there will be no occasion for donning them. The people can return to p. 52 knotted cords for their records, they can delight in their food, be proud of their clothes, be content with their dwellings, rejoice in their customs.\n\nOther states may be close neighbors, their cocks and dogs may be mutually heard, people will come to old age and die but will have no desire to go or come.\n\n\n81\n\n\n\nFaithful words are often not pleasant; pleasant words are often not faithful. Good men do not dispute; the ones who dispute are not good. The learned men are often not the wise men, nor the wise men, the learned. The wise man does not hoard, but ever working for others, he will the more exceedingly acquire. Having given to others freely, he himself will have in plenty. Tao of heaven benefits but does not injure. The wise man's Tao leads him to act but not to quarrel.".split(/([0-9]\n)/),n=[],t=0;t<e.length;t++){var o=e[t].replace(/([0-9])/,"");""!==o&&" "!==o&&"\n"!==o&&(o.match(/([0-9])/)||n.push(o))}for(var a="",i=0;i<n.length;i++){var s=n[i].trim();a+="{ chapter: ".concat(i+1,", content: `").concat(s,"`},")}a="export const text = ["+a+"];",console.log(a)}()}return(0,e.useEffect)((function(){return document.addEventListener("keydown",n),function(){document.removeEventListener("keydown",n)}}),[n]),(0,rt.jsx)("span",{})};var xt=function(){var n=a((0,e.useState)(1),2),t=n[0],o=n[1],i=a((0,e.useState)(0),2),s=i[0],r=i[1],h=a((0,e.useState)(!1),2),l=h[0],d=h[1],u=a((0,e.useState)(!1),2),c=u[0],f=u[1],p=kt.length;function m(){o(1===t?81:t-1)}function g(){o(81===t?1:t+1)}function w(){r(0===s?p-1:s-1)}function y(){r(s===p-1?0:s+1)}function b(){d(!l)}function v(){f(!l)}function T(e){"ArrowLeft"===e.key&&m(),"ArrowRight"===e.key&&g(),"ArrowDown"===e.key&&w(),"ArrowUp"===e.key&&y()," "===e.key&&(c?f(!1):l?(d(!1),f(!0)):d(!0))}return(0,e.useEffect)((function(){return document.addEventListener("keydown",T),function(){document.removeEventListener("keydown",T)}}),[T]),(0,rt.jsxs)("div",{className:"main",children:[(l||c)&&(0,rt.jsx)("div",{className:"overlay",onClick:function(){d(!1),f(!1)}}),l&&(0,rt.jsx)(Tt,{selectChapter:function(e){o(e),d(!1)},currentChapter:t}),c&&(0,rt.jsx)(It,{selectTranslation:function(e){r(e),f(!1)},currentTranslation:s}),(0,rt.jsx)(ht,{chapter:t,translation:kt[s],showChapters:b,showTranslations:v}),(0,rt.jsx)(yt,{chapterPrev:m,chapterNext:g,translationPrev:w,translationNext:y,showChapters:b,showTranslations:v}),(0,rt.jsx)(At,{})]})},Wt=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&t.e(787).then(t.bind(t,787)).then((function(n){var t=n.getCLS,o=n.getFID,a=n.getFCP,i=n.getLCP,s=n.getTTFB;t(e),o(e),a(e),i(e),s(e)}))};n.render((0,rt.jsx)(e.StrictMode,{children:(0,rt.jsx)(xt,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),Wt()}()}();
