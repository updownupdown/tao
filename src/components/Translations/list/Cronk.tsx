Naming is the mother of all particular things. Free from desire, you experience reality. Trapped in desire, you see only appearances. Reality and appearance have different names, but they emerge from the same source [that is, the Dao. This source is called darkness, deep darkness; and yet it is the way to all wisdom.`,

    content: `No beauty without ugliness. No good without evil. Being and non-being are two aspects of the same reality. Difficult and easy, long and short, high and low, before and after: With each pair, two sides of the same coin. Therefore, the Dao-Master acts with non-ado [wu-wei and teaches without speaking. Things come and go. He lets them come and go. He creates, but he does not own. He achieves, but he takes no credit. He completes his work and then forgets about it. Practice non-ado, and your accomplishments endure.`,

Therefore, the Dao-Master would rule by emptying minds and filling bellies, by weakening desire and strengthening bodies. He would lead the people away from knowing and wanting and would try to prevent those with knowledge from interfering. Practice non-ado, and everything will fall into place.`,

Others have what they need; I have nothing. I might as well be homeless. I'm a fool. Very confused. Others are bright; I am dim. Others are sharp; I am dull, lost at sea, without direction.

He doesn't boast, but he is recognized as accomplished. He doesn't contend with others, and thus no one contends with him. The old saying, "Surrender and conquer," is not an empty slogan. Surrender to the Dao and find yourself completed.`,

Allow yourself to be swept away, and you lose your foundation. Allow yourself to be moved, and you lose self-mastery.`,

But teaching and learning will not take place unless the student values the teacher and the teacher loves the student. This is the subtle secret of teaching and learning.`,

Know honor, maintain humility — become the valley of all things. Become the valley of all things, and true power [De will endure. You will find the simplicity of nature.

Make war, if necessary, and win, but without arrogance, without hostility, without pride, without needless violence. War, victory, and the rest do not last. They are contrary to Dao.

It clothes and nourishes all beings, but does not rule over them. It endures without desire and without seeming "big." The ten thousand things find their home in it, and yet it does not exercise lordship over them. The Dao is very great, but it does not show its greatness. Therefore, it is truly great.`,

    chapter: 38,
    content: `The Dao-Master does not cling to power and is therefore truly powerful. The lesser man clings to power and thus has none. The truly powerful man does nothing and thus leaves nothing undone. The lesser man is awhirl with activity and thus gets nothing accomplished. The virtuous man does what is good as an end in itself. The moral man has a need to do what is good. The man of propriety (li) makes doing good into a ritual, and if people do not follow him willingly, he forces them into line. Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises. When virtue is lost, morality arises. When morality is lost, justice arises. When justice is lost, propriety arises. Propriety is merely a shadow of justice, morality, and virtue; it is the beginning of chaos . . . . Therefore, the Dao-Master stays with the Dao. He does not live on the surface of things. He looks to the fruit, not to the flower. He accepts this Dao and rejects that non-Dao.`,

  {
    chapter: 39,
    content: `In archaic times, by attaining the One, Heaven became clear; Earth became stable; spirit became transcendent; valleys became full; the ten thousand things became alive; rulers made the country ordered and secure. This implies that if Heaven lacked clarity, it would be divided; if the Earth lacked stability, it would be shaky; if spirit lacked transcendence, it would be used up; if valleys lacked fullness, they would be depleted; if the ten thousand things lacked life, they would fade away; and if rulers lacked nobility, they would fall, and the country would collapse into chaos. Therefore, the humble is the root of the noble; the lowly is the foundation of the high. Rulers call themselves "orphans," "widows," and "worthless." This is taking the humble and the lowly as the root and foundation, is it not? You can have all the parts of a chariot without having a chariot. Better to rumble like rocks than to tinkle like jade.`,

    content: `When a thoughtful man hears of the Dao, he tries to follow it. When an average man hears of the Dao, he wonders about it, but then tends to forget it. When a fool hears of the Dao, he makes fun of it. If someone didn't make fun of it, it wouldn't be the Dao. Therefore, when seeking the Dao, light seems dark, advancing feels like retreating, the simple appears difficult, power is like weakness, purity seems tarnished, true virtue seems deficient and unsteady, and the clear seems obscure. The true square has no corners. The true vessel never sails. The true sound is hard to hear. The true form has no shape. The Dao is hidden, beyond definition; but it alone fulfills.`,

So when the new emperor is crowned (and the three ministers of state are installed), do not send gifts of jade and fourhorse chariots. Instead, be still, and offer the Dao.

Rulers who seek to enlighten the people are like bandits who prey upon the land. Rulers who forget about enlightening the people are a real blessing to the nation. Remember these two enduring principles. They represent the power [De of the Dao. De goes deep and far. All things turn back and reach original harmony.`,

    content: `Great rivers and seas are kings to hundreds of lesser streams because they lie lower than the lesser streams. To stand above, you must speak from below. To lead, you must follow behind. This is how the ruler who follows the Dao stands above and leads the people. And in this way, the people are neither overburdened nor oppressed. The whole nation supports such a ruler. He contends with no one, and no one contends with him.`,

    chapter: 67,
    content: `Many consider my teaching to be nonsense. But the profound is a lot like nonsense. If a teaching does not seem nonsensical, then it must be trivial. I have three treasures to guard and preserve: The first is compassion. The second is self-restraint. The third is not wanting to be ahead of others. Compassion breeds fortitude. Self-restraint breeds generosity. Not wanting to be ahead of others breeds leadership. These days, people want courage without compassion, generosity without self-restraint, and leadership without the willingness to be led. This is death. Compassion rules! On the attack, it wins. On the defense, it holds the fort. It is Heaven's means of aid and protection.`,

    content: `The best soldier does not rush into battle. The best fighter does not display his anger. The best conqueror does not take vengeance on his enemy. The best leader is the best follower. This is known as the power [De of not contending. This is known as true leadership. This is known as following Heaven's lead.`,

    chapter: 69,
    content: `There is a saying among military strategists: "Instead of advancing, I'll be advanced upon; it is better to retreat a foot than to advance an inch." This is known as advancing without advancing, getting ready without showing your muscles, capturing without attacking, being well-armed without weapons. There is nothing worse than underestimating your enemy. That leads to total defeat. Therefore, when armies clash, it is the side that does not rejoice in war-making that wins.`,

    chapter: 70,
    content: `My teachings are very easy to understand and even easier to put into practice. And yet, no one understands or practices them. My teachings are derived from an ancient system of principles. People who do not realize this do not really know me. Few know me, but that is my value. Therefore, the Dao-Master wears rough clothing, but has a jewel for a heart.`,

    chapter: 71,
    content: `To know that you do not know is strength. Not knowing that you do not know is a sickness. The cure begins with the recognition of the sickness. The Dao-Master is not sick, but he is sick of sickness. Thus, he is well.`,

    chapter: 72,
    content: `When the people do not fear your power, then your power has become truly great. Do not intrude into their homes. Do not interfere with their work. If you do not oppress them, then they will not become sick of you. Thus, the Dao-Master knows himself, but does not show himself. He loves himself, but is not arrogant. Therefore, he lets go of that and chooses this.`,

    chapter: 73,
    content: `A man of daring courage will kill or be killed. A man of cautious courage seeks to save lives. Each of these may be either beneficial or harmful. Heaven hates what it hates. Who knows why? Even the Dao-Master can't figure it out. The Dao does not contend, but it prevails. It does not speak, but it answers. It is not called, but it responds. It has no purpose, but it achieves all of its aims. Heaven's net is wide; nothing slips through.`,

    chapter: 74,
    content: `If people do not fear death, then you cannot threaten them with it. If they are afraid of death, we could make death the penalty for breaking the law. But do we dare to do so? Consider the role of the official executioner: Are you ready to play that role? When amateurs try to play the master carpenter, they usually cut and bruise themselves in the process.`,

    chapter: 75,
    content: `When taxes are too high, people starve. When the government is too intrusive, it makes life no longer worth living and the people lose their love of life and their fear of death. To promote the value of life, do not interfere with it.`,

    chapter: 76,
    content: `People are born soft and flexible; when they are dead, they are hard and stiff. Living plants are tender and pliant; when they are dead, they are brittle and dried out. Therefore, whatever is hard and stiff is a sign of death. Whatever is soft and flexible is a sign of life. An army without flexibility never wins. An unbending tree is easily brought down by the wind. The hard and stiff fall. The soft and flexible rise.`,

    chapter: 77,
    content: `The Dao is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. If the cord is too long, it is shortened; if it is too short, it is lengthened. The policy of the Dao is to take from those who have too much and give to those who have too little. But that is not the human practice. We take from those who have too little and give to those who have too much. Who is it that has more than enough and gives his surplus to those in need? Only the follower of the Dao. The follower of the Dao acts without hope of gain, accomplishes but takes no credit, does not wish to lord it over others.`,

    chapter: 78,
    content: `Water is soft and yielding, but nothing can more effectively dissolve the hard and inflexible. Weak defeats strong. Soft defeats hard. This is well-known, but not easy to put into practice. Therefore, the Dao-Master says: He who takes upon himself the dirt of the nation becomes the master of its sacred soil; he who takes upon himself the evils of the land becomes a true king under Heaven. Straight words seem crooked.`,

  {
    chapter: 79,
    content: `Great resentment, even when appeased, does not go away. How can this be good? Therefore, the Dao-Master keeps his promises, but he does not look into whether others are keeping theirs. The man of virtue (De) monitors himself; the man without virtue monitors others. The Dao of Heaven plays no favorites, but it is always manifest in the good man`,

    chapter: 80,
    content: `Imagine a small country with a small population. They have lots of technology, but they use none of it. They take the prospect of death seriously and thus do not travel far from home. They have boats and carriages, but no one takes them out. They have weapons and armor, but no one takes them out of the armory. Instead of writing, they have gone back to the old system of cord-knotting. They enjoy their plain but good food, their simple but fine clothing, their humble but secure homes. They are happy with their way of life. The next country is so close that the crowing of the cocks and the barking of the dogs over there can be easily heard over here; and yet the people over here grow old and die without ever having been over there.`,

  {
    chapter: 81,
    content: `True words aren't pretty; pretty words aren't true. The good do not contend; those who contend aren't good. The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise. The Dao-Master is not greedy. The more he does for others, the more he has. The more he gives to others, the richer he becomes. The Dao sharpens without cutting. The Dao-Master acts with non-ado.`,
