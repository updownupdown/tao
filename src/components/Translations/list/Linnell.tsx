beautiful, then ugliness ensues.
When all know that the action of good is goodness, then

Therefore : being and non-being create each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short contrast each other,
High and low lean on each other,
Tone and voice harmonize each other,
Before and after follow each other.
Thus the sage :
Lives by using non-action in his duties,
And practicing no-talking in his teachings.
The ten thousand creatures arise, but do not have a
beginning.
Creating but not possessing;
Acting, but not concerned with the results;
Accomplishing tasks, but not dwelling on them.

Thus the governing of the sage
Empties their heart/minds, fills their stomachs,
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.

without-knowledge and without-desire,
Those who make men wise will not dare to act.
