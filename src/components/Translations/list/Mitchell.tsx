      "The tao that can be told\nis not the eternal Tao\nThe name that can be named\nis not the eternal Name.\n\nThe unnamable is the eternally real.\nNaming is the origin\nof all particular things.\nFree from desire, you realize the mystery.\nCaught in desire, you see only the manifestations.\n\nYet mystery and manifestations\narise from the same source.\nThis source is called darkness.\n\nDarkness within darkness.\nThe gateway to all understanding.",

      "When people see some things as beautiful,\nother things become ugly.\nWhen people see some things as good,\nother things become bad.\n\nBeing and non-being create each other.\nDifficult and easy support each other.\nLong and short define each other.\nHigh and low depend on each other.\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nTherefore the Master\nacts without doing anything\nand teaches without saying anything.\nThings arise and she lets them come;\nthings disappear and she lets them go.\nShe has but doesn't possess,\nacts but doesn't expect.\nWhen her work is done, she forgets it.\nThat is why it lasts forever.",

      "If you overesteem great men,\npeople become powerless.\nIf you overvalue possessions,\npeople begin to steal.\n\nThe Master leads\nby emptying people's minds\nand filling their cores,\nby weakening their ambition\nand toughening their resolve.\nHe helps people lose everything\nthey know, everything they desire,\nand creates confusion\nin those who think that they know.\n\nPractice not-doing,\nand everything will fall into place.",

      "The Tao is infinite, eternal.\nWhy is it eternal?\nIt was never born;\nthus it can never die.\nWhy is it infinite?\nIt has no desires for itself;\nthus it is present for all beings.\n\nThe Master stays behind;\nthat is why she is ahead.\nShe is detached from all things;\nthat is why she is one with them.\nBecause she has let go of herself,\nshe is perfectly fulfilled.",

      "The supreme good is like water,\nwhich nourishes all things without trying to.\nIt is content with the low places that people disdain.\nThus it is like the Tao.\n\nIn dwelling, live close to the ground.\nIn thinking, keep to the simple.\nIn conflict, be fair and generous.\nIn governing, don't try to control.\nIn work, do what you enjoy.\nIn family life, be completely present.\n\nWhen you are content to be simply yourself\nand don't compare or compete,\neverybody will respect you.",

      "Can you coax your mind from its wandering\nand keep to the original oneness?\nCan you let your body become\nsupple as a newborn child's?\nCan you cleanse your inner vision\nuntil you see nothing but the light?\nCan you love people and lead them\nwithout imposing your will?\nCan you deal with the most vital matters\nby letting events take their course?\nCan you step back from you own mind\nand thus understand all things?\n\nGiving birth and nourishing,\nhaving without possessing,\nacting with no expectations,\nleading and not trying to control:\nthis is the supreme virtue.",

      "Success is as dangerous as failure.\nHope is as hollow as fear.\n\nWhat does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?\nWhether you go up the ladder or down it,\nyou position is shaky.\nWhen you stand with your two feet on the ground,\nyou will always keep your balance.\n\nWhat does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?\nHope and fear are both phantoms\nthat arise from thinking of the self.\nWhen we don't see the self as self,\nwhat do we have to fear?\n\nSee the world as your self.\nHave faith in the way things are.\nLove the world as your self;\nthen you can care for all things.",
