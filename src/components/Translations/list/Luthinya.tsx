The name that can be named, is not the eternal name.
The unknown is the origin of heaven and earth;
The known is the mother of the myriad things.
Therefore,
By constantly having no desire one views it's creation (of desire);
By constantly having desire, one views it's termination (into no desire).
These two have the same origin, but they differ in name;
Both are called Mystery.
Mystery after Mystery, is the gate to all wonders.`,

 Being and nothing give birth to one another,
 Hard and easy are mutually formed,
 Long and short shape each other,
 High and low complement each other,
 Music and voice are harmonized with each other,
 Front and back follow one another.
Hence,
 The sage focuses on non-action in his works,
 Practices not-saying in his speech,
 The myriad things arise but are disregarded
 The sage produces but does not own
 Acts but does not claim
 Accomplishes work but does not take credit
Only because he does not take credit, and thus the credit does not go away.`,

 People's mind are calmed,
 People's stomach are filled
 People's aspirations are lowered,
 People's physiques are strengthened;
People are kept unknowing and undesiring,
 And even the knowing ones will never dare to act,
 Action without action.

The only fear is to become instructive.
The way towards the Dao is unpaved,
Yet people like having a path.
When many are appointed to offices, while fields sprout weed,
Storages are empty,
Fashions are blatantly accessorized,
People carry weaponry,
Are satiated in feasts,
Lavished with extravaganzas,
That is making out like bandits!
Not the way of the Dao.`,

The bones are weak, the muscles are tender, yet the grip is firm.
Knows not of the union of male and female,
Yet wholly united with integrity, the very essence of exquisiteness.
Cries all day, yet the voice is not hoarsened,
The very chorus of harmony.
Understanding harmony is being eternal,

Contradict the Dao, and be brought to an early end.`,

Be unpredictable on the battlefield,
Be unoccupied to master the universe.
How do I know the essence of leadership?
With this:
The world is full of taboo and forbiddance,
And the people is immersed in poverty;
The people is armed with weaponry,
And the nation is clouded with corruption;
The people is preoccupied with professions,
And bizarre obsessions grow out of no where;
Chapters of law and orders are increasingly written,
And thievery is common.
Therefore the master maintains:
“I act not and the people naturally becomes transpired,
I believe in peace and the people naturally becomes righteous,
I am unoccupied and the people naturally becomes prosperous,
I yearn not and the people naturally becomes serene.”`,

Goodwill regresses to bewitchments,

Radiant without being glorious.`,

Femininity often overcomes masculinity with composure,
Maintaining composure is keeping a low profile.
Therefore when a great nation lurks beneath a small nation,
It can overtake the smaller nation;
When a small nation lurks beneath a great nation,
It can overtake the greater nation.
Therefore stay low in order to conquer,
Or stay low to be able to conquer.
The biggest mistake for a great nation is to be obsessed with domination,
The critical mistake for a small nation is to be obsessed with dominance.

Therefore when the leader is chosen,
And the officers are appointed,
Though you may have treasures of honor and chariots of pride to offer,
It compares not to offering a vision in the Dao.

Great accomplishments must be built on trivialities,

Hence the master is on top yet the people does not feel the weight,

Hence the world finds pleasure in pushing the master ahead
Without feeling pushed aside.
It is because the master contests not,
