The name that can be named is not the Everlasting Name
Which Nameless brought forth Heaven and Earth, which Named, it name we may,
The Mother of all the myriad things of time and space became.
Thereby we sound eternally the mystery divine,
But only without desire to sound, for if desire abide
The portals of the issuing host our baffled sight confine,
And deep within the eternal veil the mystery shall hide.
These two, the Nameless and the Named, they differ but in name,
For in their vast progression from the deep they are the same,
The deep of deeps, from whose eternal gate all spirit came.`,

When good is known as good, then bad and good together go,
Being and Non-existence, linked like brothers forward press,
And difficult and easy, both in mutual currents flow.
The long and short are side by side, each by the other shown,
The high inclines to meet the low, the low to meet the high,
The after follows the before, in mutual consequence,
And tone and voice unite and blend in mutual harmony.
And so the sage, in his affairs, does not on doing dwell,
Proceeds in silence like the myriad things which come to be,
Which growing, claim'no ownership, producing, no reward,
And claiming naught, assuming naught, continue ceaselessly.`,

With wealth unprized, the people will not take to thievish arts,
Not seeing what awakes desire will keep the mind at ease,
And so the sage's governing unloads the people's hearts.
He fills the stomach, strengthens bones, and calms the daring will,
He causes people not to know desires they should not hold,
And those who know of such he keeps, from reckless daring, still,
He acts the nothing acting, and there's nothing uncontrolled.`,

Softens the glaring light, and fills the clouds of dust that fall.
How pure and still the Tao is! as if it would endure
Forever and forever, oh! whose offspring can it be?

Regard the hundred families, too, as grass-dogs when they pass.

Collapses not, but moved again produces more and more,
But men who talk and talk exhaust themselves, and talk in vain,
And all unlikely are to keep the middle path secure.`,

Can one not open and close his heavenly gates like a bird on her nest?

Why do these two appear in guise
Of body? Just because the self
Of my own body these comprise.

To know my honor, feel my pain,
And when I count it nothingness
What sacrifice can I sustain?
When one, for honor's self alone,
Imperial rule would make his own,
He can thereby be safely used
To rule the realm and hold the throne.

And all self-sacrifice will bear,
The rule of all beneath the sky
Can be entrusted to his care.`,

I will try to picture something of these men.
Cautious they were, like one who comes to ford a wintry stream,
Irresolute, like one who enters some strange neighborhood,
Reserved, as one, a guest of some quite unknown host, would seem,
Changing, like the melting ice before a summer's flood,
Simple and unpretending as unseasoned blocks of wood,
Vacant, like a valley, and like turbid water dim.
But who can make the turbid water clear?
Leave it to rest, the mud will disappear;
But Who can make the turbid water rest?
Leave it to move, and rest will soon be here.

Wish not to fill themselves with their own self,

Are never laid, old-fashioned, on the shelf.`,

Luxuriant vegetation blooms around on every hand,
But to its root returns again, where'er it may extend,
As though its growth had traveled forth at some supreme command,
And, returning home to stillness, had thus fulfilled its end.
These returnings of command are eternal in their course,
To know of the eternal is called enlightenment,
To know not the eternal of confusion is the source,
And so awakens wickedness, and evil discontent.

A breadth of comprehension brings a kingliness of way,
The king-like grows to heaven-like, like Tao it comes to be,
Everlasting, though the body perish and decay.`,

Without a home, to desolation born.

Therefore the sage holds fast in his embrace
The Unity, and its example shows,
From self-display is free, and therefore shines,
From self-assertion, so distinguished grows,
From self-praise free, his merit is confessed,

Where myriads to sudden death are hurled,

And will fail to hold possession in the world.
In prosperous affairs the left is honored most,
But in matters of adversity the right,
