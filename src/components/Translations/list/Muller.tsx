High and low rest on each other.
Sound and voice harmonize each other.
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore the sage abides in the condition of wu-wei (unattached action).
And carries out the wordless teaching.
Here, the myriad things are made, yet not separated.
Therefore the sage produces without possessing,
Acts without expectations
And accomplishes without abiding in her accomplishments.

He clears people's minds,
Fills their bellies,

Strengthens their bones.

It will make the intellectuals not dare to meddle.
Acting without contrivance, there is no lack of manageability.`,

Having wealth in excess.

If a small state serves a large state

Always start off being simple.
Great affairs always start off being small.
