named is not an enduring name.
No names – this is the beginning of heaven and earth. Having names – this is
the mother of the things of the world.
 Make freedom from desire your constant norm; thereby you will see what is
subtle. Make having desires your constant norm; thereby you will see
what is manifest.
These two arise from the same source but have different names. Together
they may be termed ‘the mysterious’.
Mystery and more mystery: the gate of all that is subtle.`,

What is difficult and what is easy complete one another,
Long and short complement one another,
High and low incline towards one another,
Note and noise harmonize with one another,
Before and after follow one another.
 Therefore the sage dwells in the midst of non-action (wuwei) and practices
the wordless teaching.
 Herein arise the things of the world, it does not turn from them; what it gives
birth to it does not possess; what it does it does not retain. The
achievements complete, it makes no claim to them. Because it makes
no claim to them, they never leave it.`,

the right. Thus weapons are not tools of a junzi.
Weapons are ill fortuned tools; they must be used only from necessity. It is
best to use them without gusto, to prevail without relish. To relish
victory is to take joy in killing men. The man who takes joy in killing
men will never attain his ambition in the world.
Affairs of good fortune honor the left; affairs of ill fortune honor the right.
The lieutenant’s place is to the left, the commander’s place is to the

Fierce beasts will not maul him, predatory birds will not swoop down
upon him.
His bones are weak, his muscles pliable, and his grasp is firm. He knows
nothing of the female and the male, yet his male organ stirs. His
essence is at its most pure. He can scream all day and not become
hoarse. This is harmony at its height.
 Knowing harmony is called constant; knowing the constant is called
enlightened.
To increase one’s nature is called inauspicious; when the mind directs the qi
it is called self-coercion.
 When things in their prime grow old, they are called ‘contrary to the Dao’.
What is contrary to the Dao comes to an early end.`,

    content: `To order a state use uprightness; to lead troops use stratagems; to control the
world undertake nothing.
How do I know it is so? By means of this.
 As the world is filled with more taboos the people grow poorer; as the people
possess more sharp weapons the state grows benighted; as men use
more crafty skills strange goods increasingly appear; as laws are
proclaimed with increasing clarity bandits become more common.
 Hence the sage says: If I take no action the people will transform of
themselves; if I love tranquility the people will be upright of
themselves; if I undertake nothing the people will create wealth of
themselves; if I have no desires the people will of themselves become
uncarved blocks.`,

 Disaster – good fortune adheres therein; good fortune – disaster lurks
therein.
Who knows its limit? It possesses no settled norm. The norm turns into the
anomaly, the good turns into the monstrous.
It has been long indeed that men have lost their way.

straight line that cannot align, a light that does not shine.`,

Parsimony may be called ‘submitting in advance’. Submitting in
advance may be called piling up virtue (de). If you pile up virtue there
is nothing you cannot overcome, and if there is nothing you cannot
overcome, the limit of it cannot be known. When the limit cannot be
known, you may possess the state. If you possess the mother of the
state, you may long endure.
 This is called the deep root and the solid trunk; it is the dao of long gazing
upon enduring life.`,

 When one approaches governing the world by means of the Dao, ghosts will
have no potency. It is not that they have no potency, but that their
potency will not harm people, It is not that their potency will not
harm people, but that the sage too will not harm people. These two
will do no mutual harm, and therein will virtue (de) commingle and
return.`,

    chapter: 61,
    content: `A large state lies downstream; it is the female of the world. In intercourse,
the female overcomes the male by means of stillness, because stillness
lies below. Thus when the large state takes the lower position it
controls the small state. When a small state takes the lower position, it
places itself under the control of the large state. In the one case the
state takes the lower position to control, in the other it takes the lower
position to place itself under control.
Large states wish no more than to annex and nurture people; small states
wish no more than to enter into service. Both gain what they wish.
It is appropriate that the large dwell below.`,

Fine words can be marketed; honorable conduct can add to one’s rank. As
for the bad person, how can they be abandoned?
 Hence when the Son of Tian assumes the throne, in appointing the three high
ministers, he who bears the jade disk of court and presents a team of
horses is not esteemed so much as he who sits in place and offers this
dao.
 Why was this dao so esteemed in the past? Is it not said that by means of it
one will get what one seeks, and transgressors will evade punishment?
Hence it was esteemed by the world.`,

Enlarge the small, increase the few, requite hostility with virtue (de).
 Plan for the difficult on the basis of the simple, do great things on the basis of
details – the difficult undertakings of the world are all arise from
simple situations, and the greatest undertakings in the world all arise
from small details.
 Hence the sage never does a great act, and is thus able to complete his
greatness.
 Thoughtless assent always brings little trust; many easy acts always lead to
many difficulties. Therefore the sage seems to treat them as difficult,
and thus never has difficulties.`,

    chapter: 64,
    content: `When things are at rest they are easy to maintain; when situations have not
yet emerged they are easy to plan for. When brittle, things are easy to
split; when minute things are easy to disperse.
Deal with things before they occur; order things before they are disordered.
 A tree trunk several arm spans round was born of the tiniest seed. Towers
nine stories high rise from foundations of piled earth. A journey of a
thousand li begins with the first footfall.
 He who acts, fails; he who grasps, loses.
Therefore the sage takes no action (wuwei) and hence has no failure, does no
grasping and hence takes no loss.
 When people pursue an undertaking, it is always at the point of success that
they ruin it. Attend at the end as you did at the start and you will have
no failures.
 Therefore, the sage desires not to desire and does not value goods hard to
come by; he learns not to learn and redeems the errors of the masses.
Assisting the things of the world to be as they are in themselves, he dares not
act.`,

enlighten the people, they used it to make them ignorant. People are
difficult to govern is when they have much knowledge.
 Hence one who governs by means of knowledge plunders the state; one who
does not govern by means of knowledge brings fortune to the state.
Indeed, these two constitute the standard – to be always aware of the
standard is called dark virtue (de).
 Dark virtue is profound, far reaching; it revolves together with things. Only
then does it attain great compliance.`,

valleys is because they know well to take the lower position;
that is why they rule as kings over hundreds of river valleys.
Hence if you wish to rule above the people you must employ words to take
the lower position; if you wish to lead people you must place
yourself behind them.
Therefore, the sage dwells above and the people don’t consider him heavy, he
stands ahead of them and they do not consider it an injury to
them. Hence the world delights in supporting him untiringly.
Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.`,

 I possess three treasures; I protect them in my grasp. One is compassion, the
second is frugality, and third, I dare not take the lead in the world.
Compassionate, thus I can have valor; frugal, thus I can extend my
territory; unwilling to take the lead in the world, thus my works
endure.
 Now were I to discard compassion in favor of valor, frugality in favor of
territory, taking my place behind in favor of leading, I would die.
 He who goes to battle with compassion prevails; who defends his state with
compassion will be impregnable. He whom Tian wishes to save it
protects by means of compassion.`,

there is no arm, grasping where there is no weapon, struggling where
there is no enemy.

 Thus the hard and strong are followers of death; the pliant and weak are
followers of life.
 Therefore, when a weapon is strong it cannot conquer; when a tree is strong
it is put to the axe. The strong and great dwell below; the pliant and weak
dwell above.`,

supplies what is wanting, but the dao of man is not thus. It takes from
what is wanting in order to supply what has abundance.
 Who can serve Heaven by means of abundance? Only one who possesses the
