Is not the eternal way.
Eternal truths cannot be told
In what men write or say.
The name that may be named by man
Is not the eternal name
That was before the world began
Or human language came.
In that the namable took root,
The tree of fire and force,
Which, having blossomed and borne fruit,
Returns then to its source.
Who warms his body at that fire,
Sees nothing but its smoke;
But he who puts aside desire,
The flame's self may invoke.
These two things are the same in source,
But different in name;
Who solves this mystery has recourse
To that from whence he came.`,

Acts, but remains concealed.
He merits much, but does not ask
That any grant that same;
He finds his pleasure in the task,
And fears to find it fame.`,

His heart is unconfused.

Self-seeking finds surcease.

Is like a little child:
Supremely strong in every part,
Yet tender, soft, and mild.
The poisoned sting, the fang, the beak,
Strike not, nor seize, nor tear;
His grasp, although his bones be weak,
Is firm beyond compare.
He does not yield to passion's gusts,
But keeps his person pure;
He loves indeed, but never lusts,
And so he shall endure.

Knows the eternal light;

Plunged in perpetual night.n`,

In spirit and in fact.
States which are best prepared for war

Although the foolish cannot guess--

Thus everything in life depends
Upon its own reverse;
As enemies depend on friends,
And prose depends on verse.

Through lowliness towards small states,
The great state conquers all;
Just as great ones, forcing their fates,
Are conquered by the small.
So some adopt their lowliness
Because they wish the name;
Others are lowly by duress,
But conquer just the same.
A great state should desire no more
Than to unite and feed.
A smaller state, avoiding war,
Must serve the people's need.
But so that both may do their tasks,
The greater one must bend;
Not proudly, but as one who asks
The right to serve a friend.`,

That which is poor or bad;
Had he been honest, who can tell

If any man be found with sin,
Shall he be held as naught?
And yet that is the custom in
The Emperor's own court.
Better than justice, swift to kill,
And urging men to strife,
Is it to do the Father's will,
And speak the word of life.

Because, when sinners craved
To hear it, it was always heard,
And so were sinners saved.`,

Keep yourself safe from such;

Learn to begin what you must do
Before it grows too great.
Remember that the greatest task,
That conquers human will,
Was tiny once, and did not ask
Vast wisdom or much skill.
The wise man will not play the great,
Thus greatness will achieve;
For self-assurance tempts ill fate,
And braggarts none believe.

Asunder with a touch;
What is still scant may be dispersed
Before it grows too much.
Anticipate the thing to be,
And so prevent the deed.
Remember that the stoutest tree
Came from a tiny seed.
With brick on bricks, and tile on tiles,
One builds a massive wall.
The journey of a thousand miles
Begins with one footfall.
What common people undertake
Tires them e'er they begin.
They only mar what they would make,
And lose what they would win.
Who does not guard his enterprise
Until he gains his goal,
Often is taken by surprise
That robs him of the whole.
The wise man limits his desires,
And does not mount too high;
But kindles his domestic fires
Where multitudes pass by.
He helps indeed, with mind and hands,
When nature's will is clear;
But otherwise he understands
And does not interfere.`,

Who has compassion can be brave,
And who has thrift can give;
