    content: `The tau (reason) which can be tau - ed (reasoned) is not the Eternal Tau (Reason). The name which can be named is not the Eternal Name.
Non -existence is named the Antecedent of heaven and earth; and Existence is named the Mother of all things. In eternal non -existence, therefore, man seeks to pierce the primordial mystery; and, in eternal existence, to behold the issues of the Universe. But these two are one and the same, and differ only in name.
This sameness (of existence and nonexistence) I call the abyss — the abyss of abysses, the gate of all mystery.

    content: `When in the world beauty is recognized to be beautiful, straightway there is ugliness. When in the world goodness is recognized to be good, straightway there is evil. And thus, in like manner, existence and non-existence mutually originate (or suggest) each other; so also difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, treble and bass, before and after. The sage accordingly confines himself to what is without effort (not demonstrative). He carries on teaching without words ' and everything works without hindrance. He produces without holding possession. He acts without presuming on the result. He completes his work and assumes no position for himself. And, since he assumes no position, he never loses any.`,

    content: `Not exalting worth keeps the people from rivalry. Not prizing things hard to procure keeps the people from theft. Not looking on objects of lust keeps the heart from disorder. The government of the sage consists, accordingly, in emptying the heart (of desires) and filling the stomach; in weakening the will and strengthening the bones; in continually keeping the people from the knowledge and the desire (of evil); and in making those that have the knowledge not dare to act. He acts inaction, and so nothing is ungoverned.`,

It shares the dust. In tranquillity it seems ever to remain. I know not whose son it is. It appears to have been before God.`,

Where it abides, it is good for adaptability. In its heart, it is good for depth. In giving, it is good for benevolence. In speaking, it is good for fidelity.

    content: `By husbanding the animal and spiritual
souls, and embracing unity, it is possible to prevent their separation. By undivided attention to the passion-nature, and increasing tenderness, it is possible to be a little child. By putting away impurity from the hidden eye of the heart, it is possible to be without spot. By loving the people, and so governing the nation, it is possible to be unknown. In opening and shutting the heavenly doors (the mouth, the nostrils, etc.), it is possible to have no creaking. One may be bright and trans parent on all sides, and yet be unknown.
To produce and to nourish, to produce and have not, to act and expect not, to enlarge and cut not off,—this is called sublime virtue.

    content: `Favour and disgrace are as one's fear. Dignity and disaster as one's person.
What I mean to say of favour and disgrace is this: -- Disgrace is the lower place, which he who wins and he who loses equally fear; so that in the struggle for place) favour and disgrace are (only important) in proportion to one's fear (of failure). 
And what I mean by dignity and disaster being as one's person is this:—What renders me liable to great disaster is my person; so that if I had no person (body, personal importance), what disaster could I have?
So then, if, for the sake of dignity, one seeks to make himself ruler of the world, he may be permitted, indeed, to rule it temporarily; but if, for love, one seeks to make himself ruler of the world, he may be entrusted with it (for ever, or he may trust himself to the world for ever).

    content: `The skilful philosophers that were in the olden time had a mystic communication with the abysses. They were deep and cannot be known. And whereas they cannot be known, I strain my imagination to picture them. Timid were they, like one fording a stream in winter. Cautious were they, like one who dreads his neighbour. Circumspect were they, like a man from home. Vanishing were they, like ice that is about to melt. Simple were they, like unwrought wood. Vacant were they, like a valley. Dim were they, like muddy water.
Who is there that can take the turbid water, and, by stillness, make it gradually clear?
Who is there that can take what is at rest, and, by continuous motion, make it gradually alive?
Those who keep this Tau desire not fullness. And whereas they are empty, they may wax old, and yet not stand in need of renewing.

All things come into active operation together; but I observe whither they return. When things have luxuriated for a while, each returns home to its origin (the root). Going home to the origin is called stillness. It is said to be a reversion to destiny. This reversion to destiny is called eternity. He who knows (this) eternity is called bright. He who does not know (this) eternity wildly works his own misery. He who knows eternity is magnanimous. Being magnanimous, he is catholic. Being catholic, he is a king. Being a king, he is heaven. Being heaven, he is Tau. Being Tau, he is enduring. Though his body perish, he is in no danger.

He that is low shall be filled.

Therefore the sage embraces Unity, and is a pattern for all the world. He is not self displaying, and, therefore, he shines. He is not self-approving, and, therefore, he is distinguished. He is not self -praising, and, therefore, he has merit. He is not self-exalting,  and, therefore, he stands high. And inasmuch as he does not strive, no one in all the world strives with him.

Therefore, when a man in all things accords with Tau, his accordance with Tau identifies him with Tau. A man of virtue is identified with virtue. A man of default is identified with default. 
Him who is identified with Tau, (the community of) Tau also rejoices to receive. Him who is identified with Virtue, (the community of) Virtue also rejoices to receive.

It was void. It stood alone and was not changed. It pervaded everywhere and was not endangered. It may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe. I know not its name; but give it the title of Tau. If I am forced to make a name for it, I say it is Great; being Great, I say that it passes away; passing away, I say that it is far off; being far off, I say that it returns. 
Now Tau is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; a king is great. In the Universe there are four greatnesses, and a king is one of them. Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from Tau; and Tau takes its law from what it is in itself.

The adjutant general takes his place on the left, and the general- in chief takes his place on the right. Now, I say, this is just the order of a funeral.

The ministers of death are thirteen.
Human life hastens to the place of death in thirteen ways (by the undue exercise of the senses and limbs). And why is this? It is because the life men are striving to live is only the gross (physical) life (of intensified activity).
I have heard it said, that a man that is good at taking care of his life may travel over the country without meeting a rhinoceros or a tiger, and may enter an armed host without fearing their steel. The rhinoceros finds in him no place to insert his horn; the tiger finds no place to fix his claw; the weapon finds no place to receive its blade. And why is this?
It is because he is beyond the reach of death.

And this honouring of Tau and exalting of Virtue  is not the result of any command, but is spontaneous forever. For Tau produces, (Virtue) nourishes, enlarges, feeds, completes, ripens, cherishes, and covers all things.
To produce and not possess — to act and not expect — to enlarge and not control — this is called sublime Virtue.

Shut the lips and close the portals (of eyes and ears), and as long as you live you will have no trouble; but open your lips and meddle with things, and as long as you live you will not get out of trouble.

The knowledge of harmony is called everlasting. The knowledge of the everlasting is called brightness.

How do I know that this is what ought to be done? I know it from this:- When the world has many prohibitory enactments, the people become more and more poor. When
the people have many warlike weapons, the government gets more into trouble. The more craft and ingenuity that men have, the greater the number of fantastical things that come out. And, as works of cunning art are more displayed, thieves multiply.
Therefore the sage says, “ I do nothing, and the people are spontaneously transformed. I love quietness, and the people are spontaneously rectified. I take no measures, and the people become spontaneously rich. I have no lusts, and the people become spontaneously simple-minded. ”

Being able to conquer every obstacle, no limit can be seen to one's resources. And when this is the case, one may have the kingdom.

And since quietness is also lowliness, therefore a great kingdom, by lowliness towards a small kingdom, may take that small kingdom. And a small kingdom, by lowliness towards a great kingdom, may take that great kingdom. So that either the one stoops to conquer, or the other is low and conquers.
If the great kingdom only desires to attach to itself and nourish (i.e. benefit) others, then the small kingdom will only wish to enter its service. But, in order that both may have their wish, the great one should be lowly.

Therefore, in electing an emperor and appointing his nobles, if those should come bearing jewels before them and mounted on fleet steeds, they are not like the man who takes his seat, holding out this Tau (as his recommendation).

The difficult things in the world must all originate in what is easy; and the great things in the world must all originate in what is small.

He who has many easy things will have many difficulties. Therefore the sage views things as difficult and never has any difficulty.

Manage your business before it exists (takes form). Begin to regulate before the disorder comes. The tree that fills the arms grew from a slender twig. The castle of nine stories was raised from a mound of earth. The journey of a thousand miles commenced with one pace.
He that makes mars. He that grasps loses. The sage makes nothing, therefore he mars nothing. He grasps nothing, therefore he loses nothing.
People undertake things, and always fail when they are on the point of succeeding. If they were as careful of the end as they usually üre of the beginning there would be no failures.  
Therefore the sage is ambitious of no ambition; and he does not prize things difficult to get. He learns no learning; and only reverts to what others have passed over; his aim being to promote spontaneity in all things, while he dares not act (upon them).

In this way, while the sage really occupies a position above the people, they do not feel his weight. And while he occupies a position before the people, they do not suffer any inconvenience.

Because he strives not, therefore none in the world can possibly strive with him.

As for me, I have three precious things which I hold fast and prize. The first is called compassion, the second is called economy, and the third is called not daring to take the precedence of the world (humility). Being compassionate, I can therefore be brave. Being Economical, I can therefore be liberal. Not daring to take the precedence of the world, I can therefore become the chief of all the perfect ones.
But in the present day men give up compassion and cultivate only courage. They give up economy and aim only at liberality. They give up the last place and only seek the first.
It is their death. Compassion is that which is victorious in the attack, and secure in the defence. When Heaven would save a man, it encircles him with compassion.
