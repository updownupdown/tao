When you must be out in front
No one's losing ground
When you see you are not built
For facing up or confrontation
No one can contend with you
The ultimate negation`,

    chapter: 67,
    content: `I see the Dao within me
Is great beyond compare
Though many find it curious
That one would even care
Three treasures always do I keep
The first is friendliness
The second is to stay behind
The third is wanting less
For if you're friendly and you care
You'll dare to do what's needed
And if you always stay behind
The lead will be conceded
And if you're satisfied with naught
You've everything to give
Keep these treasures in your heart
And you will truly live`,

    chapter: 68,
    content: `Violence is not the way
The greatest warriors know
That treachery and anger
Will not defeat the foe
You win by never striving
There's nothing to oppose
To have the certain victory
Simplicity bestows`,

  {
    chapter: 69,
    content: `In conflict just be cautious
And always on your guard
Rather than advance an inch
Instead retreat a yard
In such a way you go along
And gain without advancing
You deal with the rival
As your status is enhancing
Remember that it's possible
Your rival just may yield
So don't advance on such a foe
Let differences be healed`,

    chapter: 70,
    content: `Embarrassingly obvious
And always near at hand
The Dao's a nothingness you see
But never understand
The way within is ageless
Yet few will ever see
A face is what I give you
The jewel within is me`,
  },

    chapter: 71,
    content: `You cannot understand the truth
Claim to know and show you're ill
Just see that you are missing
That truth is bare and nil
Unknowing is the final cure
When knowledge takes its toll
And presence is totality
When absence makes you whole`,
  },
  {
    chapter: 72,
    content: `When the sense of wonder goes
Disaster isn't far behind
Don't intrude in people's lives
The Dao is not confined
The seer sees both this and that
But doesn't ask for praise
Seers find immensity
With just an inner gaze`,

    chapter: 73,
    content: `The way is very easy
Its purposes prevail
When all is done in silence
Intention cannot fail
Its net is vast and over all
With meshes large and wide
Yet it loses nothing
And holds the whole inside`,

    chapter: 74,
    content: `You truly are what isn't born
You needn't fear to die
Live your life while knowing you
Will never lose the inner eye
You can't control what is to be
In using tools you don't command
Unlike the master carpenter
You're bound to cut your hand`,

    chapter: 75,
    content: `The people starve when taxes take
The bulk of what they earn
When leaders interfere too much
There comes rebellion in return
The people do not fear to die
If leaders rob their lives
When you take but what you need
Everybody thrives`,

    chapter: 76,
    content: `Soft and supple when we're born
Hard and rigid when we die
Living plants are pliable
Deadwood's hard and dry
The way of life befriends the weak
While death attracts the strong
The hard and stiff are bound to break
The supple bends and goes along`,
  },
  {
    chapter: 77,
    content: `Nature's way of doing
Is like the bending of a bow
For pulling on a bow you see
The low go high, the high go low
Nature takes from those who have
And gives to those who lack
When nature takes from human beings
They fight to get it back
But if you see you have it all
You're not afraid to give away
Expecting nothing in return
It all comes back without delay`,

    chapter: 78,
    content: `Water's soft and supple
It overcomes because it yields
By wearing down the hardest rock
It shows what power weakness wields
The weak can overcome the strong
The soft can overcome the hard
Everybody knows it's true
So hold the low in high regard
The seer sees serenity
Where others see affliction
The seer sees the inner truth
Where others see a fiction`,

    chapter: 79,
    content: `There's little good in making peace
If resentment lingers
You'll never see an end to blame
If everyone is pointing fingers
It's better to be pointing
At the calm and peaceful place
Where you see naught but emptiness
And others see your face`,

    chapter: 80,
    content: `If a land is small and the people few
And the rulers know what's needed
The simple ways of courtesy
Are happily and gladly heeded
For people need so little
To live their lives aright
When food and home and clothing
Are quite enough for pure delight
Though nearby lands are close enough
To hear their roosters crow
The people will be so content
That not a one will want to go`,

    chapter: 81,
    content: `Truth need not be eloquent
Nor eloquence be true
There's never need to argue
When verity shines through
Those who see may not be learned
The learned may not see
To see you merely need to look
In pure simplicity
The seer doesn't have to hoard
And doesn't fear to lose
The more you give, the more you have
So why should you refuse?
Why not give it all away?
Voidness leads to benefit
As the seers always say
The more you give, the more you get`,
