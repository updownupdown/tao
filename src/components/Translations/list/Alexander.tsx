    chapter: 1,
    content: `GOD (the great everlasting infinite First Cause from whom all things in heaven and earth proceed ) can neither be defined nor named.
For the God which can be defined or named is but the Creator, the Great Mother of all those things of which our senses have cognisance.
Now he who would gain a knowledge of the nature and attributes of the nameless and undefinable God, must first set himself free from all earthly desires, for unless he can do this, he will be unable to pene trate the material veil which interposes between him and those spiritual conditions into which he would obtain an insight
Yet the spiritual and the material, though known to us under different names, are similar in origin, and issue from the same source, and the same obscurity belongs to both, for deep indeed is the darkness which enshrouds the portals through which we have to pass, in order to gain a knowledge of these mysteries.`,

    chapter: 2,
    content: `When we have gained a knowledge of that which constitutes beauty, we shall also have gained a knowledge of that which constitutes its reverse.
When we have gained a knowledge of that which constitutes goodness, we shall also have gained a knowledge of that which constitutes evil; for all things stand in a mutual relation to each other, and so it has been said
“ Nothing and something
Are relative terms,
Easy and hard
Are the same;
The long to the short
A proportion affirms,
Which the high to the low
Also claim.
The tones and the notes
Are but modifications,
And before and behind
Only changed situations.""
Hence it is that the Sage works when apparently doing nothing, and instructs without uttering a word, ever remembering how all things in nature work silently together; coming into being and possessing nothing; fulfilling the purpose for which they were created without relying on the help of others; advancing to maturity and yet unable to remain in a state of completeness; and yet it is because of this very incapacity for continuance that they are able to continue.`,

    chapter: 3,
    content: `When men of high character are not promoted, the people will not strive to follow their example; just as when those things which are difficult to attain are not valued, thieves will not care to steal them.
In like manner, when objects which would be likely to excite evil desires are kept out of sight, men's minds will not be disturbed by them.
Therefore it is that the wise Ruler, acting on these principles, seeks to keep the minds of his subjects free from evil thoughts, whilst at the same time he fills their bellies with wholesome food; and just in proportion as he seeks to strengthen their bodies, so does he endeavour to weaken their vicious inclinations. His unceasing aim is to prevent their gaining a knowledge of depravity and vice, but should some, however, despite all his efforts, succeed in doing so, he takes care that they shall not have opportunities for making use of it, so that in the end, all, without exception, are rendered amenable to good government.`,

The Sages were not actuated by mere motives of benevolence, hence they dealt with mankind much in the same manner—that is to say, as instruments.
Heaven and Earth may be likened to the black smith's bellows, which seems to be empty when it is at rest, but when it is set in motion a continuous stream of air issues from it.

Water is peaceful and extends its beneficent action throughout Nature, not even disdaining those gloomy depths which the vulgar look upon with horror, for water works much as God does.
Now, the term “ Goodness ” has a variety of applications. It may refer to the quality of the ground upon which a house stands; or to profundity in a thinker; or to sincerity in a speaker; or to well ordered government; or to a capacity for doing; or to punctuality; but it is only when goodness is used in reference to freedom from contention that it can be considered faultless.`,

He who is able to wash himself clean from all obscure and gloomy thoughts, will become sound in mind, and—should he be a ruler — if he govern his people on principles founded on love, he will be able to remain in perfect repose and peace as he watches the processes of Nature proceed around him.
He will be as the brood hen who carries on her work when in a state of perfect rest; and who, whilst the light of intelligence may overspread the world, is able, without knowledge, to procreate and nourish; to bring forth, and not retain possession; to increase and multiply, and not to hold in subjection; to act, and not to depend upon others for assistance.

With respect to the second saying, it means that the sense of suffering is a consequence of corporeal existence; without a body there could be no bodily pain, and for the same reason there would be no personality on whom honour could be bestowed.
This is why he who does honour to his own person, or he who bestows the same love upon others as he does upon himself, may be entrusted with the government of an Empire.`,

That which you listen to and cannot hear, is called “ inaudible.”

These three definitions are difficult of realisation when taken singly, let us therefore try what can be done by bringing them together and uniting them in One.
The three negations now form a single combination, but if we scrutinise it closely, no matter in what aspect we may regard it, we shall find nothing either hidden or revealed; and let us be careful not to define it or give it a name, or it will escape from us and become even more subtle than it was before.
This is what is meant by “ seeking to define the indefinable,"" and "" to establish a resemblance between things which have no real existence.”
God is indeed a deep mystery. We cannot recognise His presence; if we advance towards Him we cannot see what is behind Him; if we follow Him we cannot see what is before Him. Yet, if we would gain a knowledge of our present lives, we must hold on to the God of the Past, and the only clue which will lead us up to Him is a knowledge of the processes which formed the beginning of that Past.`,

That which the Sages took a pleasure in doing may be likened to the wading across a swollen torrent in mid-winter,
Their caution resembled that which is produced by a fear of our associates and of those who live in our neighbourhood.
Their carriage was as the bearing of a guest towards his host.
Their self-effacement was as the melting away of an icicle.
In their indignation they were rough as a piece of unplaned wood.
Their influence was as far-reaching as the flow of a mountain torrent, and like the torrent it became turbid through its own movement.
Now who is there capable of cleansing the impurities of his nature by tranquillity and rest? And who is there capable of producing a state of perfect repose by the long-continued calm of a peaceful life?

Which each and all is bound to from the first.
He is enlightened who has well learned this; But he who knows it not will sink in sin.

It is because the Sage unites these powers in his own person that he is rendered capable of becoming a model for the whole world. He casts a bright light around him, because he has no wish to shine; he stands out prominently from others, because he is filled with humility; and it is because he is free from self -assertion, that his merit is acknowledged. It is because of his self -abnegation that his work endures, and it is because he is non contentious, that there is no power upon earth capable of opposing him.

Remember however that the man who regulates all his actions by a belief in God, will become like unto God; just as he who walks in the path of virtue will become virtuous; and he who pursues a course of vice will become vicious.

The wise ruler rests satisfied when he has gained his point, and does not presume, because he has succeeded, to adopt arbitrary measures; neither does he allow his achievement to make him either presumptuous, boastful, or arrogant.

The instruments used by the Superior Man are very different, and even when they fail him, he makes use of none other.
The great object of the Superior Man is to preserve peace and tranquillity. He takes no pleasure in winning battles, for he knows that if he did so, he would be finding gratification in the slaughter of his fellows, and he believes that he who takes delight in the destruction of his fellow -men, will never succeed in gaining the affection of those he rules over.
In all that is auspicious the left occupies the highest place; in all that is inauspicious—the right.

It is not because of their having fallen away from virtue, that the minor influences are secondary, but because they are without it.
The higher influences are passive, and aimless.
The lower influences are active, and work with a motive.
Transcendent benevolence is active, and works without a motive.
Transcendent integrity is active, and works with a motive.
Transcendent propriety is active, but when it is not exercised it has to be enforced.
Hence it came to pass that, when the knowledge of God was lost, it was replaced by virtue; that when the knowledge of virtue was lost, it was replaced by benevolence; that when the knowledge of benevolence was lost, it was replaced by integrity; and that when the knowledge of integrity was lost, it was replaced by propriety. But propriety in itself is little more than the counterfeit of sincerity and truth, and becomes in consequence the frequent cause of confusion and disorder.
From this it will be seen, that when we study the past it presents itself to us under two distinct aspects - that of a flower from God's own hand, and that of the commencement of human folly, and so it is that the Superior man seeks to establish himself on a firm and substantial basis, and to avoid all that is weak and frivolous.

Just as promises which are lightly made are lightly broken, so are things which appear most easy to accomplish often those which lead us most easily into difficulties.
