But your grip is firm.
You have not experienced the union of man and woman, yet you are whole.
You are strong.
You may shout all day without becoming hoarse.
This is perfect harmony.
Knowing harmony is constancy.
Knowing constancy is enlightenment.
It is not wise to rush about.
Trying to control the breath causes strain.
If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.
This is not the way of Tao.
Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.`,

Wage war with surprise tactics.

Because of this!

The poorer people become.
The sharper men’s weapons,
The more trouble in the land.
The more ingenious and clever people are,
The more strange things happen.
The more rules and regulations,

There is nothing like using restraint.
Restraint begins with giving up our own ideas.

If there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible.
If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.
If we know no limits, then we are fit to rule.

It will conquer the smaller nation.
And if a smaller nation submits to a great nation,
It can conquer the great nation.
Therefore those who would conquer must yield,
And those who conquer do so through yielding.
A great nation needs more people;
A small nation needs to serve.

Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,
Or the three officers of state installed,
Do not send a gift of jade and a team of horses,

A journey of a thousand miles starts under one’s feet.
Those who act defeat their own purpose;
Those who grasp lose.
The wise do not act and so are not defeated.
They do not grasp and therefore do not lose.
People usually fail when they are on the verge of success.
So give as much care to the end as to the beginning;

The third is daring not to be ahead of others.
From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;

Nowadays people shun mercy but try to be brave;
They abandon economy but try to be generous;
